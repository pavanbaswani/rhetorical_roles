The relevant facts are these.",FAC
20,"Messrs Chunilal Moonga Ram, a firm of Delhi, carried on a speculative business in bullion, mostly in ,old and silver, in Chandni Chowk at Delhi.",FAC
21,For the assessment year 1946-47 it was charged to income-tax on its income from the business in the relevant accounting period.,FAC
22,"Similarly, it was charged to excess profits tax for the chargeable accounting period ending on February 6, 1946.",FAC
23,"
One of the appeals, Civil Appeal No. 39 of 1960, arises out of the assessment of income-tax and the other appeal, Civil Appeal No. 40 of' 1960, arises out of the assessment of excess profits tax.",FAC
24,"During the relevant accounting periods the firm entered into certain transactions called ""hedge""
transactions in the billion market at Bhatinda (then a part of the Patiala State, that is, outside: the taxable territories of British India).",FAC
25,"It claimed-that it had incurred losses to non-residents there in the sums of Rs.
6,366/- and Rs. 16,615/- in the said transactions and claimed that these losses should be taken into consideration in determining its 'income.",FAC
26,"It appears from the assessment order of the Income-tax Officer, Delhi, dated January 27, 1949 that the firm purchased certain ""sillies"" (bars of gold and silver) from a Bhatinda party on the telephone, which purchases were later confirmed by a letter or wire.",FAC
27,"
Similarly, the bars were also sold by the firm through a Bhatinda party on the telephone.",FAC
28,"Apparently , no delivery was intended to be taken or was taken of the bars bought or sold ; nor did the firm have any branch or agent at Bhatinda.",FAC
29,"The transactions were in the nature of forward transactions carried out by means of telephonemessages, letters or telegrams with parties at Bhatinda.",FAC
30,"
This was the nature of the transactions Which resulted in the losses for which the firm claimed deduction.",FAC
31,"The Income-tax authorities disallowed the claim on the ground that if the Bhatinda transactions had resulted in profits, such profits would have been exempt from tax in terms of s.14(2)(c) as it then stood and if the profits were exempt from tax",FAC
32,", the proviso to a. 24(1) of the Act was a bar to the adjustment of the losses.",FAC
33,The assessee then moved the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal.,FAC
34,"The Appellate Tribunal, however, allowed the deduction claimed on grounds which are not very clearly stated.",FAC
35,"It appears; that the Tribunal proceeded on the footing that it was not possible to ,""split up transactions of a business located in the taxable territories into two categories of transactions inside and outside such territories"" and even if such spliting up was possible, the Bhatinda transactions would fall within s. 42 of the Act and the income etc. therefrom would be deemed to have arisen in British India.",FAC
36,"In this view of the matter, the Accountant Member of' the Tribunal who delivered the judgment of the Tribunal said ""To start with, it seems to us that there is no warrant either in terms of s. 14(2)(c) or in terms of the proviso to s. 24(1) to split up the transactions of a business located in the taxable territories into transactions in taxable territories and transactions without taxable territories.",FAC
37,"Even if that treatment were permitted and the profits or losses resulting from transactions outside the taxable territories can be described as income, profits and gains, such income, profits and gains are deemed under s. 42 to have accrued or arisen in British India.",FAC
38,"The results of transactions of the nature under review are' therefore, not exempt from tax by virtue of s. 14(2)(c).",FAC
39,"The proviso to s.
          214(1) does riot in any case come          into play.",FAC
40,"The Income-tax authorities have, in this view that we have, taken wrongly disallowed the assessee's claim for adjustment of losses amounting to Rs. 6,360/- and Rs.
          16,615/-.",FAC
41,"We allow these losses.""",FAC
42,"
The Tribunal accordingly allowed the two appeals.",FAC
43,We may here state that the Income-tax authorities as also the Tribunal considered the claim for deduction in relation to the assessment for income-tax only.,FAC
44,"As to the excess profits tax there was-no separate discussion of the provisions of S. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 and they dealt with the assessment of excess profits tax as a mere consequential matter.",FAC
45,"
The, Commissioner of Income-tax, Delhi, then made two applications asking the Tribunal to refer certain questions of law arising out of its orders to the High Court of Punjab,",FAC
46,The Tribunal cam to the conclusion that no questions of law arose out of its orders and rejected the applications.,FAC
47,"The High Court was then moved under s. 66 (2) of the Indian income-tax Act, 1922 and the High, Court heard the two applications together and directed the Tribunal to state a case on the following two questions which, in the opinion of the High Court, arose out of the Tribunal's orders.
          (1) Whether the claim of loss in this case is governed by the provisions of S. 10(1) or 24(1) proviso read with s. 14(2)(c), or by the provisions of s. 42 ?
 (2) Whether on the facts of the case a loss of Rs. 22,981/- is allowable in computing the income of the assessee chargeable to the Excess Profits Tax ?""",RLC
48,"
The Tribunal then' drew up a statement of case on the two questions aforesaid.",RLC
49,"By its judgement and order dated January 23, 1957 the High Court answered both the questions in favour of theassessee.",RLC
50,"Thereafter the Commissioner of Incometax, Delhi, asked for and obtained a certificate under s.66A(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act and on that certificate the present appeals have been brought to this Court.",FAC
51,"
As to the first question the learned Additional Solicitor- General, appearing on behalf of the appellant, has conceded that him 'not in a, position to dispute the correctness of the answer given, in view of the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Indo-Mercantile Bank Ltd. (1).",ARG_PETITIONER
52,"
This disposes of Civil Appeal No. 39 of 1960 which must be dismissed.",ARG_PETITIONER
53,"
In Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1960 the second question falls for decision.",ANALYSIS
54,"In answering this second question the High Court has proceeded on two grounds : firstly, it has referred to s.5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, particularly the third proviss thereto, and contracting the provisions of that section with s.5 of the Business Profits Tax Act of 1947 has expressed the view that neither of these provisions touched the question whether losses incurred in an Indian State could be taken into account in assessing the taxable income of an assessee in British India for purposes of assessing excess profits tax or business profits tax ; it then referred to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Karamchand Premchand Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay (2) and said: ""It would seem that inspite of the slightly different language of the Excess Profits Tax Act from that of the Income-tax Act, no distinction has ever been drawn in this matter between the principles governing assessment to income-tax and the principles governing assessment to excess profits tax and in fact it would appear to have been the universal (1) (1959) 36 I.T.R, 1.
(2) (1956)30I.T.R.849,          practice that decisions of the Income-tax authorities and High Courts have been followed by consequential orders relating to the same assessee's taxable income for the purpose of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the learned counsel for the Commissioner has not been able to cite any decision in which different principles have been applied in this particular matter.",ANALYSIS
55,"Admittedly one of the reasons given in his judgment by Chagla C.J.
          for coming to the decision mentioned above 'was that the third proviso had been changed in the Business Profits Tax Act as compared with the Excess Profit-, Tax Act, but this is only one of a number of reasons and the questions has not been considered at all whether under the proviso in the Excess Profits Tax Act losses made in an Indian State could have been computed in assessing the assessee's income from business in British India.",ANALYSIS
56,"I can only say that in the circumstances it seems to me likely that if the point had arisen the same view that I.
          have expressed above would have been taken, namely, that whereas for the excess profits tax profits earned in an Indian State could not be taken into consideration at all, such profits could be taken into account if brought into taxable territories for assessing profits tax and that is regards losses.",ANALYSIS
57,"they I could be taken into account in assessing the business whether they occurred in a State. or in what was British India.""",ANALYSIS
58,"
The second ground given by the High Court depended on the facts found.",ANALYSIS
59,"The High Court expressed the view that, on the facts found it was doubtful if the losses in question could be deemed to have occurred in Bhatinda.",ANALYSIS
60,"
It said ""It is not in dispute that the only place where the assessee carries on business is Delhi and that its transactions in other markets are carried out by means of commu- nication by telephone or Post.",ANALYSIS
61,"There is no Suggestion that the firm has any agent or branch in any native State and it therefore seems to me that whether profits result or losses are incurred as the result of transac- tions of this kind even with firms in Indian States, the profits accrue or the losses are incurred at the place where the payments are received or from which they are made, namely, the firm's place of business at Delhi.""",ANALYSIS
62,"
On behalf of the appellant it is contended that both the aforesaid grounds given by the High Court for the answer which it gave to the second question are unsubstantial.",ANALYSIS
63,"
The, first ground, it is contended, is untenable in law, and the second.",ANALYSIS
64,"proceeds not on the findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunal but on new findings made by the High Court, which course was not open to the High Court to take.",ANALYSIS
65,"
We consider that these contentions are correct.",ANALYSIS
66,"As to the first ground, it seems clear to us that under the third proviso to s.5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 where the profits etc., of a part of the firm's business accrued or arose it Bhatinda, that part of the, business shall for the purpose of the said section be deemed to be a separate business.",ANALYSIS
67,If that is so the losses which arose at Bhatinda must also be the losses of a separate business.,ANALYSIS
68,"We may here read s.5 and the third proviso thereto : .lm15 "" s. 5.",STA
69,"This act shall apply to every business of which any part of the profits made during the chargeable accounting period is chargeable to income-tax by virtue of the provisions of sub-clause (i) on sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of subsection (1) of section 4 of theIndian Income-tax Act, 1922, or of clause (c) of that sub-section : Provided further that this act shall not apply to any business the whole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and where the profits of a part of a business accrue or arise in an Indian State, such part shall, for the purposes of this provision, be deemed to be a separate business the "",hole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and the other part of the busi- ness shall, for all the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be, a separate business.""",STA
70,In Commissioner of Income-tax v. Karamchand Premchand Ltd.(1).,PRE_RELIED
71,"This Court considered s. 5. of the Business Profits Tax Act, 1947 and pointed out the distinction between the third proviso thereto and the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1.940.",PRE_RELIED
72,"This Court quoted. with approval the decision in Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Bombay City v. Bhogilal H. Patel Bombay (2 ) and held that the language used in the third proviso to S. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 was one of exclusion and that Act did not apply to profits etc. of that part of the business which arose in an Indian State.",PRE_RELIED
73,"If that part of the business has to be treated as a separate business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act, it is difficult to see how the losses incurred in an Indian State can be taken into consideration for the same purposes.",ANALYSIS
74,We think that the High Court was in error in thinking that the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act did not touch the question which the High Court had to answer.,ANALYSIS
75,"On the (2) (1952) 21 I.T.R. 72, (1) (1960) 40 I.T.R. 106.contrary, we think that the proviso answers the question against the assessee.",ANALYSIS
76,"Now, as to the second ground given by the High Court.",ANALYSIS
77,"It seems to us that there can be no doubt that the assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that the losses for which the assessee firm claimed a deduction arose and were incurred at Bhatinda, even though the firm's place of business was Delhi.",ANALYSIS
78,"The Income-tax Officer, as also the Appellate Assistant Commissioner referred to s. 14(2)(c ) of the Income-tax Act, 1922; that provision related to income, profit-, or gains accruing or arising in an Indian State.",ANALYSIS
79,"
The assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that as the proof its we are exempt from tax in terms of s.
14(2)(c), the losses arising out-. side the taxable territories could not be taken into account.",ANALYSIS
80,"The Tribunal did not rely on s. 14(2)(c), nor on the proviso to s. 24 (1) of the Income-tax Act, 1922.",ANALYSIS
81,But it relied on s.42.,ANALYSIS
82,"That again shows that it proceeded on the footing that though the income actually arose outside the taxable territories, it should be deemed to have arisen with in the taxable territories by reason of its business connection in the taxable territories.",ANALYSIS
83,The High Court had to answer the second question on the facts found; it could not.arrived at fresh findings of fact.,ANALYSIS
84,Such a course was not open to it.,ANALYSIS
85,"
Indeed, it is true that the Tribunal said that the firm's transactions could not be split up, but the actual decision of the tribunal proceeded on the basis that.",ANALYSIS
86,"even it the transactions could be split up, s.42 applied and the income actually arising at Bhatinda would be deemed to have arisen in the taxable territories and so the losses must be taken into consideration for arriving at the income.",ANALYSIS
87,The Tribunal considered the matter solely from the point of view of the assessment of income-tax.,ANALYSIS
88,"It did not consider the third proviso to s. 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940 and what effect it had in the matter of the assessment of' excess profits tax.",ANALYSIS
89,"We agree that if the incomedid not arise or accrue in Bhatinda but the whole of it arose in Delhi, the third proviso would have no application.",ANALYSIS
90,"
If however, part of the income etc. arose in Bhatinda, there that part of the business was a separate, business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the losses' incurred at Bhatinda could not be taken into account.",ANALYSIS
91,"We are of the view that on the facts found, the answer to the second question must be in favour of the appellant and against the assessee.",RPC
92,"Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1960 must, therefore, be allowed.",RPC

The two appeals were heard together and in view of the divided success of the parties, the parties must bear their own costs in both appeals.",RPC

349,"The words other games of any sort"" are of wide amplitude.",ANALYSIS
350,Their meaning is not confined to games of a gambling nature alone.,ANALYSIS
351,It thus appears that sub-clause (ix) is not confined to mere gambling or betting activities.,ANALYSIS
352,"But, says the High Court, the meaning of all.",ANALYSIS
353,the aforesaid words is controlled by the word 'winnings' occurring at the inception of the subclause.,ANALYSIS
354,"
The High Court says, relying upon certain material, that the expression winnings' has come to acquire a particular meaning viz, receipts from activities of a gambling or betting nature alone.",ANALYSIS
355,"Assuming that the High Court is right in its interpretation of the expression 'winnings', does it follow that merely becausewinnings from gambling/betting activities are included within the ambit of income,the monies received from non- gambling and non-betting activities are not so included?",ANALYSIS
356,"
What is the implication flowing from insertion of clause (ix)?",ANALYSIS
357,If the monies which are not earned-in the true sense of the word-constitute income why do moneies earned by skill and toil not constitute income?,ANALYSIS

361,The respondent- assessee entered the contest to win it and to win the first prize.,ANALYSIS
362,What he got was a return' for his skill and endurance.,ANALYSIS
363,Then why is it not income-which expression must be construed in its widest sense.,ANALYSIS
364,"Further, even if a receipt does not fall within subclause (ix), or for that matter, any of the sub-clauses in section 2(24), it may yet constitute income.",ANALYSIS
365,"To say otherwise, would mean reading the several clauses in section 2(24) as exhaustive of the meaning of 'income' when the Statute expressly says that it is inclusive.",ANALYSIS
366,"It would be a wrong approach to try to place a given receipt under one or the other sub-clauses in section 2(24) and if it does not fall under any of the sub- clauses, to say that it does not constitute income.",ANALYSIS
367,"Even if a receipt does not fall within the ambit of any of the sub- clauses in section 2(24), it may still be income if it partakes of the nature of the income.",ANALYSIS
368,The idea behind providing inclusive definition in section 2(24) is not to limit its meaning but to widen its net.,ANALYSIS
369,"This Court has repeatedly said that the word 'income' is of widest amplitude, and that it must be given its natural and grammatical meaning.",ANALYSIS
370,"Judging from the above standpoint, the receipt concerned herein is also income.",ANALYSIS
371,May be it is causal in nature but it is income nevertheless.,ANALYSIS
372,That even the casual income is 'income' is evident from section 10 (3).,ANALYSIS
373,Section 10 seeks to exempt certain 'incomes' from being included in the total income'.,ANALYSIS
374,"A casual receipt which should mean, in the context, casual income is liable to be included in the total income if it is in excess of Rs.
1,000, by virtue of clause (3) of section 10.",ANALYSIS
375,"Even though it is a clause exempting a particular receipt/income to a limited extent, it is yet relevant on the meaning of the expression 'income'.",ANALYSIS
376,"In our respectful opinion, the High Court, having found that the receipt in question does not fall within sub-clause (ix) of section 2(24), erred in concluding that it does not constitute income.",ANALYSIS
377,The High Court has read the several sub-clauses in section 2(24) as exhaustive of the definition of income when in fact it is not so.,ANALYSIS
378,In this connection it is relevant to notice the finding of the Tribunal.,ANALYSIS
379,It found that the receipt in question was casual in nature but-it opined-it was nevertheless not an income receipt and fell outside the provision of section 10 (3) of the Act.,ANALYSIS
380,We have found it difficult to follow the logic behind the argument.,ANALYSIS
381,11. For the above reasons we hold that the receipt in question herein doesconstitute 'income' as defined in clause (24) of section 2 of the Act.,RPC

 This appeal arises out of a complaint filed before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Calcutta by one Manindra Narayan Choudhury, Operation Manager of the Grindlays Bank Ltd. against the twelve appellants, referred to above, for offences punishable under section 341, Indian Penal Code and section 36AD of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 said to have been committed by them on October 31, 1977.",FAC

419,"The said appeal came to be disposed of after nearly six years on December 19, 1984.",FAC
420,The High Court felt that the trial court had missed the essence of the offences with which the appellants had been charged and therefore there was failure of justice.,RLC
421,"Hence it set aside the judgment of acquittal passed by the Magistrate and remanded the case for retrial for offences punishable under section 341 read with section 34 or section 149, Indian Penal Code.",RLC

We are of the view that having regard to the nature of the acts alleged to have been committed by the appellants and other attendant circumstances, this was a case in which the High Court should have directed the dropping of the proceedings in exercise of its inherent powers under section 482, Criminal Procedure Code even if for some reason on it came to the conclusion that the acquittal was wrong.",ANALYSIS

526,": The Police Inspector of Women Police Station, Mysuru city has filed the charge sheet against accused for the offences punishable under sections 498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C., Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.
 2. The brief facts of the case of the prosecution are that:- The complainant and accused No.1 married on 09.07.2009 before the Sub-Registrar at Mysuru and thereafter the said marriage was performed before the elders on 20.09.2010 at Kendaganneshwara temple. It is alleged in the complaint that the accused demanded for Rs.10,00,000/- and gold ornaments. The parents of the complainant gave Rs.10,00,000/- and other gold ornaments as per the demand.
It is alleged that the accused No.1 to 3 started harassing the complainant for one or the other reason. The accused abused the complainant in filthy language. The complainant has alleged that the accused subjected her for physical assault.
The accused demanded for further dowry amount from the complainant. Even after receipt of Rs.2,00,000/- after the marriage the accused did not bother to take care of the complainant. It is also alleged that the accused demanded money for the purchase of Zen Car. The accused used to come to the place of work of the complainant and pick up quarrel with her. The complainant was driven out of the house and the gold and silver articles and the amount which was received as dowry by the accused was not returned to the complainant. Hence the complaint is lodged by the complainant against the accused No.1 to 4 before the concerned police. CW.12 has registered the case against the accused. CW.13 has further conducted the investigation and filed the charge sheet against the accused No.1 to 4 for offences punishable U/s.498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C. and Section 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act.

 4. The prosecution has examined PW.1 to 3 and the documents are marked as Ex.P1 to P4.",FAC
527,"6. The points that emerge for consideration are:- 1) Whether the prosecution proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused No.1 being the husband of CW.1 in furtherance of common intention has ill treated the complainant and the accused No.1 to 3 started harassing the complainant and abused the complainant in filthy language and he subjected her for physical assault also even after receipt of Rs.2,00,000/- after the marriage the accused did not bother to take care of the complainant and the accused used to come to the place of work of the complainant and pick up quarrel with her, the complainant was driven out of the house and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 498(A) R/w section 34 of I.P.C.?
 2) Whether the prosecution further proves beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of marriage, the accused demanded for Rs.10,00,000/- and gold ornaments and the parents of the complainant gave Rs.10,00,000/- and other gold ornaments as per the demand and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 3 of Dowry Prohibition Act?

 4) What Order?",ISSUE
528,"The contents of the complaint are that the complainant and the accused No.1 married on 09.07.2009 before the Sub-Registrar, Mysuru and thereafter the marriage was performed before the elders on 20.09.2010.

The accused demanded for money to open a shop and a Gym center. Even after compliance of the dowwry the accused harassed the complainant. The accused demanded for Zen Car. The accused also caused harassment to the complainant in her work place. The evidence of PW.1 is totally contrary to the complaint. PW.1 has not deposed in accordance with the contents of the complaint. When the complainant turned hostile and not supported the case of the prosecution she was cross examined by the learned APP.

 The Revenue has preferred this appeal against the order passed by the Tribunal, which has set-aside the order passed by the Lower Authorities on the ground that the undisclosed income is to be assessed in the hands of the HUF, insofar as the lottery business is concerned and insofar as the finance business is concerned, it is to be assessed as AOP under the name Easy Finance and not under the name of the assessee in his individual capacity.
 2.",RLC
548,"The assessee is doing lottery business under the trade name M/s. Luck Associates, Mangalore.",FAC
549,He is also running unregistered finance business under the name and style of Easy Finance.,FAC
550,"A search as conducted on 10.11.2000 and a cash of Rs.8,00,000/- was seized and gold jewellery weighing 430 grams was found.",FAC
551,"The assessee in his statement stated that the main stockists of lottery were M/s.Pooja Agencies and M/s. Ganesh Agencies of Delhi, M/s. Sri Laxmi Venkatesh Lottery, Mangalore and M/s. M & Co., Bangalore.",FAC
552,"The Assessing Authority passed an order on 29.11.2002 under Section 158BC read with Section 143(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short, hereinafter referred to as `the Act').",FAC
553,The Assessing Authority did not accept the case of the assessee and held that the undisclosed income offered has to be assessed in the name of the assessee in his individual capacity in respect of both lottery business and finance business.,FAC
554,"Aggrieved by the said order, the assessee preferred an appeal to the Commissioner of Income-tax(Appeals), who affirmed the said order.",FAC
555,"
Thereafter, the Assessee preferred a second appeal to the Tribunal.",FAC
556,"
 3. The Tribunal, on consideration of the entire material on record took note of the fact that the assessee's father by name Harshad Rai Pajwani has got HUF registered under the provisions of the Sales tax on 02.08.1999.",FAC
557,"However, he died on 16.10.1999.",FAC
558,"
Thereafter, the son carried on the said lottery business as kartha of the HUF.",FAC
559,"Therefore, the Tribunal was of the view that the authorities were not justified in assessing the undisclosed income relatable to the lottery business in the hands of the individual, but it ought to be assessed in the hands of the HUF.",RLC

 (ii) Whether the Tribunal was right in deleting the addition made representing the assessed income from finance business by holding that it represented the income of AOP solely on the basis of investment made in finance business when factually no AOP existed?",ISSUE

569,"The Tribunal has taken note of the undisputed fact that the father of the assessee got registered the HUF under the provisions of the Sales Tax on 02.08.1999, which is not in dispute.",ANALYSIS
570,It shows that the father wanted to do lottery business as HUF.,ANALYSIS
571,"
Unfortunately, within two months there from, that is on 16.10.1999, the father died.",ANALYSIS
572,It is the case of the assessee that he continued the said business as the Kartha of the HUF.,ANALYSIS
573,The reason given by the Lower Authorities to come to the conclusion that the amount is to be assessed in the hands of the assessee as an individual instead of HUF is that the HUF did not have money to invest in this business as they have not maintained any accounts.,ANALYSIS
574,The said inference drawn by the assessing authority is without any basis.,ANALYSIS
575,"As is clear from the aforesaid facts, the sales tax registration was done on 02.08.1999 and within two months, the father died.",ANALYSIS
576,"Therefore, the question of the father maintaining the books of accounts, would not arise.",ANALYSIS
577,"After the death of the father, the son is carrying on with the said business.",ANALYSIS
578,"If he had maintained the accounts and if he had disclosed all the amounts in the accounts, it seems that it would not have been treated as undisclosed income.",ANALYSIS
579,"It is because books were not maintained and returns were not filed, the authorities laid their hands on the undisclosed income.",ANALYSIS
580,"Therefore, the Tribunal was justified in the facts of the case in holding that the said amount is to be assessed in the hands of the HUF in the aforesaid circumstances and not in the hands of the assessee in his individual capacity.",ANALYSIS
581,"In fact during such proceedings, the assessee had requested the authorities to adjust this undisclosed income and seized cash as advance tax for HUF and therefore, we do not find any infirmity in the order passed by the Tribunal, which calls for interference.",ANALYSIS
582,"Hence, we answer the first substantial question of law in favour of the assessee and against the Revenue.",ANALYSIS

 7. Insofar as the second substantial question of law is concerned, it is not in dispute that the seized materials disclose the names of the three persons namely, Manish, Jagadish and Rajesh.",ANALYSIS
584,They were carrying on the finance business under the name and style of `Easy Finance' as Association of Persons.,ANALYSIS

587,"The returns filed by the assessee on 24th August, 2001 for all the three years from 1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 shows undisclosed income as Nil.",ANALYSIS
588,In the light of the aforesaid evidence on record the undisclosed income relatable to the finance business is to be assessed in the hands of the AOP and not as an individual.,RPC

HELD : The assessee was not liable till the purchase of
declared goods acquired the character of a last purchase
within the Second Schedule of the Act. It is true that Ss.
3 and 4 of the Madras General Sales Tax Act, speak of ""a
year"", i.e., the financial year, and it is only the turnover
during that year that is liable to taxation in the hands of
the assessee, but s. 4 has to be read with the Second
Schedule, and reading s. 4 with the Second Schedule, it is",PREAMBLE
600,"
clear that a dealer is not liable to pay a tax on the
purchases until the Purchases acquire ,the quality of being
last purchases inside the State",PREAMBLE
601,". In, other words, when he
files a return and declares the stock in hand, the stock in
hand cannot be said to have been acquired by last purchase

it or he may consume it himself or the goods may be
destroyed, etc.",PREAMBLE

633,"""Turnover"" is defined in S. 2(r) as follows ""'turnover' means the aggregate amount for which goods are bought or sold, or supplied or distributed, by a dealer, either directly or through another, on his                         own account or on account of others whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration, provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce, other than tea, grown within the State by himself or on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner, usufructuary mortgagee, tenant or otherwise. shall be excluded from his turnover;......",STA
634,The learned counsel for the appellant says that it is clear from ss. 3 and 4 that a tax under the Madras Act is a yearly tax.,ARG_PETITIONER
635,"In other words, he says, that just as under the, Indian Income Tax Act each assessment year is a self- contained unit, so is the assessment year a self-contained unit under the Madras Act.",ARG_PETITIONER
636,"If that is so, he argues, then what happens in subsequent year-., cannot be taken into consideration for determining the taxability of any purchase inside the State of declared goods.",ARG_PETITIONER
637,He says that the taxable event is the last purchase in the State during the assessment year and if stocks are held at the end of the assessment year it follows that the assessee holding the stocks is the last purchaser in the State.,ARG_PETITIONER
638,"
In our opinion, this reasoning is fallacious.",ANALYSIS
639,"It is true that ss. 3 and 4 speak of ""a year"", i.e., the financial year, and it is only the turnover during that year that is liable to taxation in the hands of the assessee, but s. 4 has to be read with the Second Schedule, and reading s. 4 with the Second Schedule, it seems to us clear that a dealer is not liable to pay a tax on the purchases until the purchases acquire the quality of being the last purchases inside the State.",ANALYSIS
640,"In other words, when he files a return and declares the stock in hand, the stock in hand cannot be said to have been acquired by last purchase because he may still during the next assessment year,, sell it or he may consume it himself or the goods may be destroyed, etc.",ANALYSIS
641,He would be entitled to claim before the assessing authorities that the character of acquisition of the stock in hand was undetermined; in the light of subsequent events it may or may not become The last purchase inside the State.,ANALYSIS
642,"
In our view this construction is in consonance with s. 15 of the Central Act.",ANALYSIS
643,"If the argument of the learned counsel for the State were to be accepted it would mean that the States could with impunity levy purchase tax on declared goods at more than one stage, i.e. on purchases in the hands of one dealer during one assessment year and purchases of the same goods in the hands of another dealer in a subsequent assessment year, and so on.",ANALYSIS
644,"Therefore, we agree with the Madras High Court that the assessee is right in contending that he was entitled to claim deduction in respect of the value of the stock of Rs. 2,27,250 as being the purchases other than last purchases of cotton.",ANALYSIS
645,"
L7 Sup. Cl/67-1 0The Kerala High Court in Abdulsalam Rowther v. State of Kerala(1), following certain cases decided under the Income Tax Act, was influenced by the consideration that an assessee could not rely on subsequent events in order to escape taxation'",PRE_RELIED
646,"That may be so even under the Sales Tax Act, but, according to our view, the assessee is not liable till the purchase of declared goods acquires the character of a last purchase within the Second Schedule referred to above.",ANALYSIS
647,In Hornusji Hirjibhoy v. Commercial Tax Officer(1) the Mysore High Court also seems to have been impressed by similar considerations.,PRE_RELIED
648,"
The judgment under appeal draws a distinction between tax- able event and a stage at which the levy of tax in the case of declared goods is subject to single point levy.",ANALYSIS
649,"This may cause confusion, and indeed, the High Court gives one illustration, which it found unnecessary to deal with.",ANALYSIS
650,"The illustration given is : ""One can visualise a case for example, where goods mentioned above purchased on the 30th of March, 1960 may be exported by the purchaser himself, outside the State, on the 2nd of April, 1960.",ANALYSIS
651,"In that case the goods could not be assessed in 1960-61 in the hands of the exporting purchaser, because the taxable event did not occur in that year; it could not be assessed in the hands of the seller in 1959-60 because though the taxable event occurred that year, the single point stage was not reached in that year.",ANALYSIS
652,"One possible way of dealing with such a case is to assess it subsequently as escaped turnover.""
 ",ANALYSIS
653,"In our opinion, in this illustration, the assessee would be liable in the financial year 1960-61 as the purchases became the last purchases in that year.",RPC

Left with no other alternative, he filed this suit for declaration and injunction.",FAC

705,Point No.3: As per final order for following REASONS 11.,ANALYSIS
706,Point No.1:,ARG_PETITIONER
707,The Learned Counsel appearing for the appellant vehemently canvassed that the plaintiff who is a Lingayath is married to Annapurna and has got two children in the said wed lock.,ARG_PETITIONER
708,The Family Court while disposing of the C.Mis. filed by the defendants' mother held that the she is not the legally wedded wife of the plaintiff.,ARG_PETITIONER
709,The Trail Court erred in not properly appreciating Ex.P3 sworn to by DW1 and produced before the school authorities seeking change of the defendants' father's name as `Yusuf' in the place of Suresh.,ARG_PETITIONER

712,"It was contended by him that since the plaintiff has not chosen to assail the judgment in RPFC 8/2004, the finding that the defendants are the children of the plaintiff has become final.",ARG_RESPONDENT
713,"In Ex.P3, a printed Form there is a huge blank space between the typed matter and DW1's signature, which is not even identified by anybody.",ARG_RESPONDENT
714,Merely because the signature is affixed in English it cannot be presumed that DW1 is a literate.,ARG_RESPONDENT
715,Ex.P3 is a concocted document.,ARG_RESPONDENT
716,"
 13. In the light of the above rival contentions, if the evidence on record is carefully examined, it is seen that, the question whether PW1 is married to Annapurna and has children through her is irrelevant for the purpose of this case.",ANALYSIS
717,The trial court thus has rightly held that the Ex.P7 to Ex.P13 are not material to the matter in issue.,ANALYSIS
718,"
 14. Further, the findings of the Family Court in C.Mis.135/00 that the mother of the defendants is not the legally wedded wife of the plaintiff has reached finality, as the said order is confirmed by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka, in RPFC No.8/2004.",ANALYSIS
719,Further no relief is claimed against her in the suit filed by the plaintiff.,ANALYSIS
720,"
 15. The only issue that requires to be considered is whether the defendants are the children of the plaintiff or not?",ANALYSIS
721,"The plaintiff to discharge the burden cast upon him, relies mainly on Ex.P3 which is an affidavit sworn to by Sabeena Parveen for change of her husband's name in the school records Yousuf on the ground that it is wrongly entered as Suresh in respect of her daughter Fathimmunnisa.",ANALYSIS
722,"
 16. On perusal of Ex.P3 it is seen that there is a huge gap between the typed portion and DW1's signature which is not even identified by any Advocate.",ANALYSIS
723,"Ex.P3 is said to have been sworn to before certain S.Sundararaja Iyengar, a Notary on 24.7.1997.",ANALYSIS
724,"DW1 categorically states that the plaintiff admitted Fathimunnisa to C.K.C.Convent and that she has not appeared before any Notary on 24.07.1997.
 17.",ANALYSIS
725,"No doubt Ex.P6, report of the expert commissioner is to the effect that the signature of DW1 on Ex.P3 is the same as the one found on the vakalathnama and the written statement filed by DW1 on behalf of minor defendants in this case.",ANALYSIS
726,"
DW1 specifically states that the name of the first defendant's father as seen in the birth certificate Ex.P5 was entered as instructed by the plaintiff.",ANALYSIS
727,"
 18. Ex.D1 is the Certificate issued by Christ Convent, 30.1.2003 to the effect that the 1st defendant is the daughter of G.Suresh i.e., the plaintiff and that she is a student of their Institution; her date of birth is 15.9.1990 as per the school records.",ANALYSIS

736,PW1 says that he does not know who handed over Ex.P3 to School authorities.,ANALYSIS

 21. PW2, H.M. of C K C Convent unequivocally admits that in Ex.P2, the 1st defendant's father's name is entered as G.Suresh and even in the application submitted at the time of her admission it was mentioned so.",ANALYSIS
738,"According to PW2 only during 2004, on the basis of Ex.P3 she has struck off `Suresh' in Ex.P5 and changed it as `Yusuf' that after the plaintiff brought filing of such affidavit to her knowledge.",ANALYSIS

 23. Ex.D5 is NCR issued by the SHO of Ashokapuram Police Station, Mysore to DW1 in respect of a complaint against her husband Suresha.",ANALYSIS
743,"Ex.D8 is the endorsement issued on 1.7.2000, with respect to this complaint.",ANALYSIS
744,"If at all the plaintiff was not at all known to DW1 as claimed, how DW1 could give his name as her husband's name or lodge a complaint against him as early as in 1990 and year 2000",ANALYSIS
745,has also remained unanswered.,ANALYSIS
746,"
 24. On perusal Ex.P14, it is seen that the Family Court had held that the plaintiff herein and DW1 though were residing together as husband and wife, yet DW1 could not be his legally wedded wife on account of the fact that she had remained a Muslim.",ANALYSIS
747,"This finding has not bee set aside, varied or modified by the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in RPFC. No.8/2004.",ANALYSIS
748,Therefore the same has reached finality.,ANALYSIS
749,"
 25. The evidence on record indicates that PW2 on being prompted by the plaintiff has struck off the plaintiff's name appearing in the 1st defendant's school records without intimating the defendants or their mother.",ANALYSIS
750,"Ex.P3 is dated 24.7.1997, but PW2 has acted upon the same somewhere during the year 2005.",ANALYSIS
751,Therefore it appears that on account of his strained relationship with DW1 the plaintiff has engineered changes in the entries made in the school records.,ANALYSIS
752,"26. Ex.P15, 17 and 18 are issued by the statutory authorities such as Election Commission, City Corporation, Mysore and these documents speak to the effect that the plaintiff and DW1 were residing together as husband and wife; and the 1st defendant was born to them.",ANALYSIS
753,The plaintiff is bound by his documents and cannot retract from its contents.,ANALYSIS
754,"
 27. Ex.D1, Certificate dated 30.1.2003 issued by the H.M. of C.K.C. Higher Primary School, Mysore, in respect of 2nd defendant and Ex.D4 issued by the Dy.Director of Public Instructions",ANALYSIS
755,"clearly establish that the plaintiff is the father of the defendants.

756,Paternity is a question of fact.,ANALYSIS
757,The plaintiff is just hanging on to Ex.P3 to prove his case.,ANALYSIS

 30. Point No.2:",ARG_PETITIONER
763,"The Learned Counsel for the appellant relies upon the decision in Madhusudan Das Vs Narayani Bai & Ors. reported in AIR 1983 SC 114 wherein it is held that: ""In an appeal against a Trial Court decree, when the appellate court considers an issue turning on oral evidence it must bear in mind that it does not enjoy the advantage which the trial court had in having the witnesses before it and of observing the manner in which they gave their testimony.",ARG_PETITIONER
764,"When there is a conflict of oral evidence on any matter in issue and its resolution turns upon the credibility of the witnesses, the general rule is that the appellate court should permit the findings of fact rendered by the trial court to prevail unless it clearly appears that some special feature about the evidence of a particular witness has escaped the notice of the trial court or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to displace its opinion as to where the credibility lies.""

Where a tenant with full knowledge of the fats, either expressly or in writing or impliedly by acts, such as the payment of rent, attorns tenant to a person other than his original landlord or one who is claiming the estate of interest of such original landlord by assignment, succession, or othewise, he is ordinarily estopped from questioning the title of the person to whom he has so attorned.",ANALYSIS

Dhobi appellant No. 1 was an agricultural assistant and was working under Khairnar appellant No. 2 who was agriculturalsupervisor in the soil conservation section of the Government of Maharashtra.",FAC
1012,Dhobi was incharge of the work relating to a Bundh in block No. 13 of village Asane in Taluka Mandurbar.,FAC
1013,"The above block comprises agricultural lands bearing survey Nos. 8, 17, 18, 19 and 32 measuring 90 acres.",FAC
1014,The Bundhs were being constructed since the year 1962.,FAC
1015,Rectification work in respect of those Bundhs at a cost of Rs. 369.07 had to be got done by Dhobi appellant under the supervision of Khaimar appellant.,FAC
1016,The Government sanctioned an amount of Rs. 4779 in connection with the construction of the Bundhs.,FAC
1017,"An advance amount of Rs. 5000 was received by Khaimar accused on March 2, 1966 in that connection.",FAC

The case of the prosecution was that the measurement book Ex. 27, paysheets Ex. 64, final bill Ex. 28 and cash book entry Ex. 32 were false documents and were fabricated by the accused without doing any reification work on the Bundh.",FAC

The accused thus committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the amount of Rs. 369.07 in furtherance of their common intention to misappropriate government property.",FAC

Sarpanch Tanku sent complaint Ex. 84, in the meanwhile, on April 30, 1966 to the director of anti-corruption branch Maharashtra State stating that the accused had prepared false bill for Rs. 369.07 without doing any work and that they had misappropriated that amount.",FAC
1048,It was also stated that attempts were being made to shield the accused.,FAC

On appeal the High Court affirmed the, findings of the learned special judge.",FAC
1071,"
We have heard Mr. Kotwal on behalf of the, appellants and are of the opinion that there is no merit in the appeal.",ANALYSIS
1072,"It has not been disrupted before us that the accused made various entries and prepared documents on March 11, 1966 about their having got the rectification work done as well as about the payment of Rs. 369.07 on that account.",ANALYSIS
1073,It has also not been disputed before us that the amount of Rs. 369- 07 was not paid to any one by the accused in March or April 1966.,ANALYSIS
1074,"According to Ghate (PW 1) and Inamdar (PW 11), no work relating to the rectification of the Bundh was found to have been done till May 11, 1966 when they visited the site in question.",ANALYSIS
1075,"Inamdar's evidence also shows that according to the measurement book prepared by the accused, 83 pits had been recently dug although the witness could not find a single pit on the spot.",ANALYSIS
1076,"In view of the above, we find no cogent ground to disagree with the trial court and the High Court that the accused had prepared false documents and had also committed criminal breach of trust in respectof the amount of Rs. 369.07.",ANALYSIS
1077,We also agree with the trial court and the High Court that the accused were in the discharge of their duties guilty of criminal misconduct as defined in section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.,ANALYSIS
1078,"
Mr. Kotwal has argued that the accused completed the recti- fication work after May 11, 1966,.",ANALYSIS
1079,"There is, however, no direct evidence as may show that the, rectification work was completed' after May 11, 1966.",ANALYSIS
1080,"Even if it may be assumed that the accused completed the rectification work in May 1966, that fact, in our opinion, would not absolve the accused of their criminal liability.",ANALYSIS
1081,"The charge, against the accused relates to preparation of false documents because even though no work had been done till March 11, 1966 and no amount had been disbursed, they prepared docu- ments showing the doing of that work and the payment of that amount.",ANALYSIS
1082,"It is no answer to, that charge that after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities, the accused in the month of May 1966 got the rectification work done.",ANALYSIS
1083,"It is also no answer to a charge of criminal misappropriation that the money was subsequently, after the matter had been reported to the high authorities, disbursed for the purpose for which it had been entrusted.",ANALYSIS
1084,"According to explanation 1 to section 403 Indian Penal Code, a dishonest misappropriation for a time only is ""
misappropriation "" within the meaning of that section.",ANALYSIS
1085,"
Mr. Kotwal has also submitted that the accused expressed willingness to complete the work after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities.",ANALYSIS
1086,"This submission, 'even if accepted, would not exonerate the accused because the willingness after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities could not efface or undo the offence earlier committed by the accused.",ANALYSIS
1087,"
Argument has then been advanced on behalf of the appellants that Sub Inspector Patil did not make investigation in the case in accordance with law.",ANALYSIS
1088,"It is urged that permission to make investigation was granted to Sub Inspector Patil on November 12, 1966 and, as such, he was not authorized to make before that date the enquiry which led to the registration of the case as that enquiry partook of the character of investigation.",ANALYSIS
1089,Nothing has been brought to our notice as to how an enquiry before the registration of a case can be held to be investigation.,ANALYSIS
1090,"The matter, however, need not be dilated upon and it is not necessary to express any final opinion in the matter because we find that there is no material on the record as may show that the accused were prejudiced because of the alleged non-compliance with the provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act.",ANALYSIS
1091,"It is well established that where cxognizance of a case has, in fact, been taken by the court on a police report following investigationconducted in breach of provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act, the result of the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice.",ANALYSIS
1092,The underlying reason for the above dictum is that an illegality committed in the course of investigation does not affect the competence and jurisdiction of the court to try the accused.,ANALYSIS
1093,"Where, therefore, the trial of the case has proceeded to termination, the invalidity of the proceeding investigation would not vitiate the conviction of the accused as a result of the trial unless the illegality in the investigation has caused prejudice to the accused (see H.

1094,"Since there has been no miscarriage of justice in the present case because of the alleged non-compliance with section 5A, the conviction of the accused appellants cannot be set aside on that score.",ANALYSIS
1095,"
For the same reason, we are unable to accede to the contention of Mr. Kotwal that the conviction of the accused should be set aside because permission under section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act to SI Patil for investigation of the offence was granted in a ,casual manner and without the existence of sufficient reasons.",ANALYSIS
1096,"
 Lastly, it has been argued by Mr. Kotwal that the prosecution of the accused was barred by time under section 23 of the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes, Act, 1942.",ANALYSIS
1097,"The section reads as under ""(1) No suit, prosecution or other legal proceeding shall be instituted against any public servant or person duly authorized under this Act in respect of anything in good faith done or intended to be done under this Act or the rules made thereunder.

Sub-section (1) of the section has plainly no application as it relates to anything done in good faith.",STA
1098,"According to Bombay General Clauses Act, a thing shall be deemed to be done in good faith where it is in fact done honestly, whether it is done negligently or not.",ANALYSIS
1099,"The appellants admittedly were not acting honestly when they prepared the false documents in question and showed disbursement of Rs.
369.07 on March 11, 1966.",ANALYSIS
1100,"Mr. Kotwal, however, relies on sub-section (2) of section 23 and (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1150.
 submits that the prosecution could be instituted against the appellants only within six months from March 11, 1966.",ANALYSIS
1101,"As the charge sheet was submitted long after the expire of six months, the case against the accused-appellants, according to the counsel, was barred by time.",ANALYSIS
1102,"This contention, in our opinion, is devoid of force.",ANALYSIS
1103,Sub-section (2) refers to suit or prosecution against a public servant or person duly authorized under the Act in respect of anything done or intended to be done under the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes Act.,ANALYSIS
1104,It cannot be said that the acts of the accused-appellants in preparing false documents and in committing criminal breach of trust in respect of the amount of Rs. 369-07 as also their act of criminal misconduct were done under the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes Act.,ANALYSIS
1105,Sub- section (2) of section 23 deals with anything done or intended to be done under the above mentioned Act by a public servant or a person duly authorized under the Act.,ANALYSIS
1106,"
 It has no application where something is done not under the Act even though it has been done by a public servant who has been entrusted with duties of carrying out improvement schemes under the above mentioned Act.",ANALYSIS

applicable thereto.

HEADNOTE:

A question of sentence is a matter of discretion and it is

well settled that when discretion has been properly

exercised along accepted judicial lines, an appellate court

",PREAMBLE

except for very strong reasons which must be disclosed on",PREAMBLE
1193,"

1194,".

In a matter of enhancement there             should not be

interference when the sentence passed imposes substantial

punishment.",PREAMBLE
1195,"Interference is only called for when it is

manifestly inadequate.",PREAMBLE
1196,"

In the circumstances and bearing all the considerations of

the present case in mind it was impossible to hold that the

Sessions Judge did not impose a substantial sentence.

The Supreme Court set aside the sentence imposed by the

Court and restored that of the Sessions Judge as no adequate

reason bad been assigned by the High Court for considering

the sentence passed by the Sessions Judge as manifestly

inadequate.",PREAMBLE

1209,"The appellant Bed Raj and another, Sri Chand, were jointly charged with the murder of one Pheru.",FAC
1210,"The Sessions Judge convicted Bed Raj under section 304, Indian Penal Code, and sentenced him to three years' rigorous imprisonment.",RLC
1211,He acquitted Sri Chand.,RLC
1212,"I Bed Raj appealed to the High, Court and that Court, on admitting the appeal for hearing, issued notice to the appellant to show cause why the sentence should not be enhanced.",RLC
1213,The appeal and the revision were heard together.,RLC
1214,"
 The appeal was dismissed and the High Court enhanced the sentence to ten years.",RLC
1215,"
 Now, though no limitation has been placed on the High Court's power to enhance it is nevertheless a judicial act and, like all judicial acts involving an exercise of discretion, must be exercised along, well known judicial lines.",FAC
1216,The only question before us is whether those lines have been observed in the present case.,FAC
1217,"
 The facts that have been found by the Sessions Judge and accepted by the High Court are to be found in the opening paragraph of the learned Sessions Judge's judgment.",FAC
1218,"They are as follows: ""Roop Chand, the son of Bed Raj accused, was removing the dung.",FAC
1219,of the bullocks of Pheru deceased from an open space near his cattle shed.,FAC
1220,"Pheru protested to, the boy and turned down the basket in which the boy had put the dung.",FAC
1221,The two accused who are brothers then came to the scene from their own cattle shed which was near by and there was an exchange of abuses between them and Pheru.,FAC
1222,The accused Sri Chand then caught hold of Pheru by the waist and Bed Raj accused took out a knife and stabbed him in 3 or 4 places.,FAC
1223,"
 The knife was then left sticking in the neck of the deceased and the accused ran away"".",FAC
1224,"
 The assault occurred about 8 o'clock on the morning of the 23rd February 1952.",FAC
1225,Pheru was removed to the hospital and the Medical Officer Dr. Fateh Singh examined him and found that he was suffering from shock.,FAC
1226,"He found three injuries on his person: all ""simple"".",FAC
1227,He gave the following description of them: right side lower part.,FAC
1228,"
 (2) Incised wound: 1 "" x 1/3"" X1/3"" right deltoid region frontal and lower part above downward.",FAC
1229,"
 (3) Incised wound 1/2"" X 1/6"" X 1/4""Epigastric region"".
 ",FAC
1230,"He said- ""When Pheru was admitted in the hospital he was under shock but his condition was not dangerous",FAC
1231,. When Pheru came he could speak.,FAC
1232,He was not unconscious.,FAC
1233,As he was under shock no report was made for recording his dying declaration.,FAC
1234,I cannot give the definite cause of death.,FAC
1235,I cannot tell if sucH an InjurY can cause death.,FAC
1236,There was no Haemorrhage from Pheru's neck after his arrival in my hospital.,FAC
1237,"Speaking:of the inJurieis, the doctor said- ""Injuries 2 and 3 on the person of Pheru which were incised wounds were not punctured.",FAC
1238,"It was not possible to inflict them from a sharp pointed weapon"".",FAC
1239,"
 The appellant was also examined by the doctor and a slight simple injury, which could have; been caused by a simple blunt weapon, was discovered.",FAC
1240,"This indicates that there was a scuffle between the appellant and the deceased, in which the appellant was hit over the nose and, up to a point, bears out what the appellant says in his defence, namely that Pheru was beating the appellant's son Rup Chand; he went there and tried to extricate Rup Chand; Pheru started beating him (the appellant) and he, the appellant, received a flat blow on the nose.
 ",FAC
1241,The depth of the injury on Pheru's neck was I of an inch.,FAC
1242,"
In this connection the doctor says- ""A knife can penetrate 1 1/2 or 2 inches in a case of deliberate stabbing"".",FAC
1243,"
 Pheru died about 12-45 A.M. on the 24th February 1952, that is to say, about 16 or 17 hours after the assault.",FAC
1244,"The post-mortem was conducted by another doctor, Dr. J. K.
Dwivedi.",FAC
1245,"Describing the injury on the neck-the only one we need consider as the other two were slight-he said that clotted blood was present all round injury No, 1, and, that--""the:right side dome of pleura is punctured under injury No.
1 and clotted blood present all round it.",FAC
1246,"Upper lobe of right lung (appex) is punctured for 1/4"" X 1/4"" X 1/2"".",FAC

Clotted blood present over the lung surface all round the punctured area.",FAC
1248,A branch of the external jugular vein was divided in right side neck under injury No. I.,FAC
1249,"Death was due to shock, and haemorrhage as a result of injury to neck"".",FAC
1250,"In cross-examination he said- ""It was possible and impossible also that the bleeding could be stopped.",FAC
1251,"Such injury as injury No. I are more likely to cause death"".",FAC
1252,"After reviewing the evidence 'the learned Sessions Judge held- ""It is evident that the whole scene took just a few moments.",RLC
1253,"Both of the accused must have been in a moment of heat and before either of them could think of doing any act, the whole thing was over........",RLC
1254,"That the injuries with the knife were likely to cause death is clear but they were caused at a time when the parties were in a heat and there was a sudden fight and no room for premeditation"".
 ",RLC
1255,"Because of this, and seeing that there was no reason to infer pre-concert, he acquitted the other accused, and by reason of those circumstances he considered that three years would be sufficient punishment and sentenced the appellant accordingly.",RLC
1256,This was on 17-11-1952.,FAC
1257,"
The appellant filed an appeal to the High Court on 1.8-12- 1952 and that Court thereupon issued notice to him to show cause why the sentence I should not be enhanced.",FAC
1258,The High Court directed enhancement on 7-1-1954.,FAC
1259,"
 On the same day the State Government ordered the release of the appellant on probation, under section 2 of the U.P.
Prisoners' Release on Probation Act, 1938, for the full term of the sentence imposed by the Sessions Court.",FAC
1260,"We are not concerned with the State Government's order except in so far' as it indicates the view that that Government took of the antecedents and conduct in prison of the appellant, matters that are also relevant for consideration by a Courtwhen determining a, question of sentence-' a prisoner can only be released on probation under that Act if the State Government is satisfied ""from his antecedents and his conduct in the prison that he is likely to abstain from crime and lead a peaceable life, if he is released from prison"".
 ",ANALYSIS
1261,These facts were not known to the High Court when it made its order of enhancement' but it is a matter relevant for our consideration now that the appeal is before us.,ANALYSIS
1262,"
 Now the High Court accept the findings of the Sessions Judge about the circumstances in which the offence took place.",ANALYSIS
1263,"
They agree that the attack was not premeditated and that there was a sudden quarrel and that the blows were inflicted in the heat of passion,.",ANALYSIS
1264,They also say that there was counter-abuse and they notice the abrasion on the appellant's nose.,ANALYSIS
1265,"Despite this they hold-that' ""it is possible that this injury was received by the appellant in the attempt of the deceased to resist the attack made by the appellant.",ANALYSIS
1266,There was therefore no fight'.,ANALYSIS
1267,"
 This is a very half-hearted finding and ignores the fact that the benefit of all doubts must be given to the accused.",ANALYSIS
1268,"
If it was only ""possible"" that the injury was due to Pheru's attempt to ward off an attack by the appellant, then it must be equally ""possible"" that it was received in the course of a, scuffle.",ANALYSIS
1269,"The appellant very definitely says in his examination that there was a fight and the abrasion on his nose which the doctor says was caused by a blunt weapon, bears out his version that Pheru struck him with his fist.",ANALYSIS
1270,"
The circumstances also indicate that there must have been a scuffle.",ANALYSIS
1271,Why else should it be necessary for the second accused to come and hold him down by the waist?,ANALYSIS
1272,"When villagers or any man for that matter, come to blows after hot words and an interchange of abuse, there is nearly always resistance to the initial attack.",ANALYSIS
1273,"Very rarely does a man ""turn the other cheek"".",ANALYSIS
1274,It must also be remembered that the incident started with the use of force by Pheru.,ANALYSIS
1275,It was he who took hold of the basket of cow dung andoverturned it.,ANALYSIS
1276,"That occasioned the quarrel, and the finding is that there was abuse and counter-abuse.",ANALYSIS
1277,It was then that the second accused rushed in and caught Pheru by the waist.,ANALYSIS
1278,"
That accused was acquitted because there was nothing to suggest that that was done in aid of the appellant's intention to-assault Pheru and he -was absolved of all intention to assault on his own account; and the finding is that even the appellant had no such intention till the last moment.",ANALYSIS
1279,"If that was the case, then why should the second accused rush in and hold Pheru by the waist?",ANALYSIS
1280,"If he had no intention to assault on his own account and none to assist the appellant in his assault, the only other reasonable conclusion is that he tried to stop a fight.",ANALYSIS
1281,"It would be fair in the circumstances to reach that conclusion, for the accused is as much entitled to the benefit of any doubt when a co-accused is acquitted as in any other case.",ANALYSIS
1282,"In any case, it was incumbent on the High Court to reach a more definite finding than the one given before -deciding to enhance the sentence.",ANALYSIS
1283,"
 The only reason that the learned Judges give is that Pheru was unarmed and as the attack was made with a knife it cannot be said that the appellant did not act in a cruel or unusual manner.",ANALYSIS
1284,"Nevertheless, they uphold the finding that the offence falls under section 304, Indian Penal Code, and not under section 302.",ANALYSIS
1285,"
 A question of a sentence is a matter of discretion and it is well settled that when discretion has been properly exercised along accepted judicial lines, an appellate court should not interfere to the detriment of an accused person except for very strong reasons which must be disclosed on the face of the judgment; see for example the observations in Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab(1) and Nar Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2).",PRE_RELIED
1286,In a matter of enhancement there should not be interference when the sentence passed imposes substantial punishment.,RATIO
1287,Interference is only called for when it is manifestly inadequate.,RATIO

(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 238, 241,impossible to hold in'the circumstances described that the Sessions Judge did not impose a substantial, sentence, and no adequate reason has been assigned by the learned High Court Judges for considering the sentence, manifestly inadequate.",RATIO

1346,"According to the complainant, R (PW10) was introduced to the deceased Arun and they used to regularly talk to each other on phone every day and therefore, accused Siva could not tolerate that his girlfriend should shift loyalty to some other person.",FAC

 9. Admittedly, there are no eyewitnesses to the case and this is a case based on circumstantial evidence.",ANALYSIS
1356,"The law with regard to appreciation of circumstantial evidence has been clearly enunciated in the case of Hanumant v. State of Madhya Pradesh1, wherein this Court held as follows: ""10......It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.",PRE_RELIED
1357,"Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.",PRE_RELIED
1358,"In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.""",PRE_RELIED
1359,"
 10. This law has been consistently followed and has been repeated in catena of authorities.",ANALYSIS
1360,It is not necessary to refer to all the authorities.,ANALYSIS
1361,"However, we may refer to Sir Alfred Wills book Wills on Circumstantial Evidence (Chapter VI)2, in which he has laid down the following Rules specially to be observed in the case of circumstantial evidence: ""RULE 1.  The facts alleged as the basis of any legal inference must be clearly proved, and beyond reasonable doubt connected with the factum probandum............
 1 AIR 1952 SC 343 2 Butterworths, Seventh Edition, Pp 296-329.

                  RULE 5.",ANALYSIS
1365," If there by any reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, he is entitled as of right to be acquitted.""",ANALYSIS
1366,"
 11. The law can be summarised in the following terms: 1. The circumstances relied upon by the prosecution which lead to an inference to the guilt of the accused must be proved beyond doubt; 2. The circumstances should unerringly point towards the guilt of the accused; 3. The circumstances should be linked together in such a manner that the cumulative effect of the chain formed by joining the links is so complete that it leads to only one conclusion i.e. the guilt of the accused; 4. That there should be no probability of the crime having been committed by a person other than the accused.",ANALYSIS
1367,12. It is in the light of the aforesaid law that we have to consider the evidence and the circumstances relied upon by the courts below.,ANALYSIS
1368,"
 13. In a case based on circumstantial evidence it is always better for the courts to deal with each circumstance separately and then link the circumstances which have been proved to arrive at a conclusion.",ANALYSIS
1369,"Unfortunately, in this case, though a reference has been made to some circumstances, the circumstances have not been discussed separately.",ANALYSIS
1370,"Therefore, we propose to discuss the various circumstances relied upon by the prosecution: 1.",ANALYSIS
1371,LAST SEEN TOGETHER,ANALYSIS
1372,"As far as this circumstance is concerned, the same stands proved.",ANALYSIS
1373,It is the case of all that Room No. 203 in Meena Guest House was hired by the two accused and the deceased.,ANALYSIS
1374,"Venki came at about 9.30 p.m., but he left at 10.15 p.m. Thereafter the lodge was locked.",ANALYSIS
1375,"Therefore, this circumstance is proved.",ANALYSIS
1376,"Though this circumstance is proved, we must also look into the circumstances under which the accused were last seen together with the deceased.",ANALYSIS
1377,The case of the prosecution is that it is the accused who took the deceased to the room with the intention of killing him since the accused Siva suspected that R (PW10) was having an affair with the deceased.,ANALYSIS
1378,"
However, the manner in which the accused reached Chennai and the guest house in question suggests a total different story.",ANALYSIS
1379,"The maternal uncle of the deceased (PW1) states that one Jeyaraj, an employee of PW5 informed him over the phone at about 6/7 p.m. on 30.10.2004 that the deceased Arun along with his friend Siddharth was coming to stay in the night with PW1 at Chennai.",ANALYSIS
1380,"A few minutes later, PW1 talked to his nephew Arun, who also told him that he would be coming to his uncle's house but did not come.",ANALYSIS
1381,Siddharth is the son of Gomti Pandian (PW7).,ANALYSIS
1382,"
According to her, Siddharth told her that he was going to Chennai along with his friend Arun (deceased) to purchase some clothes.",ANALYSIS
1383,She was reluctant to send her son with his friend but then she talked to Arun who told her that they would be going to Chennai by bus and convinced her to send Siddharth with him.,ANALYSIS
1384,She dropped Siddharth at the bus stand.,ANALYSIS
1385,Later she came to know that her son Siddharth had gone to Chennai along with the deceased Arun and three other persons in a car which had met with an accident.,ANALYSIS
1386,"She was informed about this by Kala Devi (PW8), whose son Mathesh had also travelled in the same car.",ANALYSIS
1387,"
Thus, it is clear that it was Arun (deceased), who convinced Siddharth's mother to send Siddharth with him.",ANALYSIS
1388,"This witness also stated that later her son informed her that the car had met with an accident and, thereafter, he and Mathesh did not proceed to Chennai and returned to their homes.",ANALYSIS
1389,PW8 states that her son Mathesh had told her that he was going to Coimbatore.,ANALYSIS
1390,Next morning she received a call from her brother's son.,ANALYSIS
1391,He told her that the car in which Mathesh was travelling had met with an accident.,ANALYSIS
1392,"
She was also told that Mathesh along with his friends Siva, Chandru, Siddharth and Arun came to the house of her brother and thereafter Mathesh returned to home.",ANALYSIS
1393,"Thus, it is clear that Siddharth and Mathesh were also travelling in the car and they would have also gone to Chennai but for the fact that the car met with an accident.",ANALYSIS
1394,"Thereafter, Siddharth and Mathesh did not proceed further and returned to their homes.",ANALYSIS
1395,"As such, it is clear that it was not the accused, who had organised the trip but it was the deceased, who had organised the trip and, therefore, it cannot be said that the accused had taken the deceased to the guest house with the intention of killing him.",ANALYSIS
1396,This assumption by both the courts below is based on no evidence.,ANALYSIS
1397,"
 2. MEDICAL EVIDENCE",ANALYSIS
1398,Medical evidence led in this case clearly indicates that the deceased died due to overdose of Tidijesic.,ANALYSIS
1399,"It is not disputed that 4 ml of Tidijesic was injected into the wrist of the deceased by Venki, who administered 2 ml of the same substance into himself and thereafter the deceased died.",ANALYSIS
1400,"
   The evidence of Dr. R. Baskaran (PW11), who is Professor and Head of the Department of Legal and Forensic Medicines, Royapettai Government Hospital, Chennai clearly shows that after chemical analysis it was found that the amount of the offending substance found in the blood of the deceased would be equal to injecting 40 ml of Tidijesic.",ANALYSIS
1401,"
Therefore, there is no manner of doubt that the deceased died due to overdosing of drug.",ANALYSIS
1402,"
 PW11 stated that if a 20 ml syringe is used then about 40 ml of Tidijesic could be injected in two attempts.",ANALYSIS
1403,"However, if a 5 ml syringe is used, it would require 810 attempts.",ANALYSIS
1404,He clearly states that he cannot tell when and how this 40 ml Tidijesic was injected into the body of the deceased.,ANALYSIS
1405,He also could not state what time the death had occurred.,ANALYSIS
1406,"He also stated that it takes 6 to 24 hours for the drug to take effect and this would further depend upon the quantity of the drug, the physique and the actions of the person injected.",ANALYSIS
1407,"
Therefore, his statement does not help us with regard to the time of death or with regard to the number of attempts in which the drug was injected into the body of the deceased.",ANALYSIS
1408,"
Even in the postmortem report the approximate time of death has not been indicated.",ANALYSIS
1409,"Dr. A.N. Shanmugham (PW 6), who conducted the postmortem also could not say when the death took place.",ANALYSIS
1410,"
 Dr. A.N. Shanmugham (PW6) in his statement had stated that injuries caused by the needle due to injection of medicine were found in fore arm, ankle of front foot, front and middle fore arm.",ANALYSIS
1411,"He has been confronted with the post mortem report (PD5), in which there is mention of only two injection marks  one in front of left elbow joint and one in middle of left fore arm.",ANALYSIS
1412,It is clearly mentioned that no other external or internal injuries seen over the body.,ANALYSIS
1413,He has not been able to give a proper explanation why he did not mention other injuries in the postmortem report.,ANALYSIS
1414,This would mean that the deceased was injected only twice.,ANALYSIS
1415,"
 It is the case of the prosecution that on the first occasion the deceased was injected with 4 ml Tidijesic.",ANALYSIS
1416,"Therefore, 36 ml could not have been injected in one go on the next occasion.",ANALYSIS
1417,The police has not recovered any syringe or other material from the room.,ANALYSIS
1418,"As per the prosecution case, the lodge was locked at about 10.30 p.m..",ANALYSIS
1419,The next morning the deceased was found dead.,ANALYSIS
1420,No recoveries of any ampoules or syringe have been made from the accused or at their instance to connect them with the offence.,ANALYSIS
1421,"
 The prosecution, by means of the aforesaid medical evidence, has failed to link the accused with the death of the deceased.",ANALYSIS
1422,The prosecution has failed to prove the exact time of death of the deceased.,ANALYSIS
1423,The deceased was first injected an injection between 9.30 p.m. to 10.00 p.m..,ANALYSIS
1424,"As per doctor, the effect of this could end in about six hours.",ANALYSIS
1425,"
Therefore, the possibility of the deceased getting up himself in the middle of the night to inject himself cannot be ruled out.",ANALYSIS
1426,There is also the possibility of his calling some other person to inject him with the drug.,ANALYSIS
1427,"Even more importantly, the prosecution has failed to prove where the balance 36 ml of drug came from.",ANALYSIS
1428,Who got this drug and when?,ANALYSIS
1429,There is no evidence that the accused purchased this drug.,ANALYSIS
1430,"No recovery has been made from them and, therefore, we are of the view that though it stands proved that the deceased died due to overdose of drug, the prosecution has miserably failed to link the accused with the death of the deceased.",ANALYSIS
1431,3. MOTIVE,ANALYSIS
1432,"The motive put forth is that R (PW10) was close to accused Siva, who introduced her to Arun.",ANALYSIS
1433,"According to the case set up by the prosecution, the two had developed a close relationship and were regularly chatting with each other on phone and through SMSes.",ANALYSIS
1434,"This was not liked by Siva (Accused No.1), who thereafter conspired with Chandru (Accused No. 2) to kill the deceased by overdosing him.",ANALYSIS
1435,"R (PW10) in her statement has not at all supported the prosecution case and according to her, she had never met Arun but had talked to him over phone and that too occasionally.",ANALYSIS
1436,She also stated that she and the deceased Arun would exchange SMSes which were usual in nature.,ANALYSIS
1437,"
   She, in crossexamination, denied the suggestion that she used to talk to Arun every day.",ANALYSIS
1438,She stated that they talked generally about matters relating to college.,ANALYSIS
1439,She also denied that she had any special relationship with Siva.,ANALYSIS
1440,"According to her, Siva was her friend being a collegemate.",ANALYSIS
1441,No other evidence has been led to prove that R (PW10) had any special relationship with accused Siva or that she had developed any special relationship with deceased Arun.,ANALYSIS
1442,"The only evidence in this regard is the statement of R (PW10), which does not support the prosecution case at all.",ANALYSIS
1443,"
 In this regard, it would also be pertinent to mention that in the first complaint filed by PW1, there is no mention of R (PW10), much less of her having any affair with either the accused or the deceased.",ANALYSIS
1444,This was brought out for the first time only in the complaint filed four years after the death of Arun.,ANALYSIS
1445,There is no explanation for this long silence of four years.,ANALYSIS
1446,"Therefore, we are clearly of the view that the motive has not been proved.",ANALYSIS
1447,We must also remember that the accused and the deceased were good friends.,ANALYSIS
1448,They had studied for many years together and there is not even an iota of evidence about such love triangle.,ANALYSIS
1449,"
 4. CHANDRU WAS A MEDICAL STUDENT",ANALYSIS
1450,Both the courts below have come to the conclusion that Chandru was asked by Siva to commit the crime because Chandru was a medical student and he alone knew how to inject the substance into the body of the deceased.,ANALYSIS
1451,We are constrained to observe that the inference drawn by the courts below was totally ill founded.,ANALYSIS
1452,Why would Chandru kill another human being just on the asking of the accused Siva?,ANALYSIS
1453,"Chandru was a medical student, studying in a profession meant to save lives and not to kill people.",ANALYSIS
1454,From the evidence on record it stands established that the deceased was a drug addict and had been taking injectible drugs for a long time.,ANALYSIS
1455,It is well known that such drug addicts can easily inject themselves.,ANALYSIS
1456,What has happened in this case is not clear but it cannot be said with certainty that Chandru had injected the poisonous substance into the body of the deceased.,ANALYSIS
1457,There is no evidence in this regard.,ANALYSIS
1458,"
As we have discussed above, it was not only Siva and Chandru who were coming to Chennai with deceased Arun but Siddharth and Mathesh were also coming to Chennai in the same car.",ANALYSIS
1459,"However, they went back only after the car met with an accident.",ANALYSIS
1460,All these boys were in their late teens or early 20s and two of them got scared after the accident and they went to the homes of their relatives and from there they contacted their respective mothers.,ANALYSIS
1461,"Since they had obtained permission of their mothers by giving false excuses, they got scared and went back.",ANALYSIS
1462,"Even as per the prosecution, Chandru had no motive to kill Arun.",ANALYSIS
1463,"
Therefore, the inference drawn by the High Court as well as the trial court that Siva and Chandru had conspired or had the common intention of murdering Arun is not based on any cogent or reliable evidence.",ANALYSIS
1464,"14. Other than the circumstances referred to above, there are other circumstances which go against the prosecution which we shall refer to now: 1. Inconsistency in the statement of PW1  PW1 is the maternal uncle of the deceased.",ANALYSIS
1465,"In his first complaint made in the police station on 31.10.2004, there is no reference to R (PW10) or other facts which have been stated at a later stage.",ANALYSIS
1466,The private complaint filed by him four years later is contrary to the first complaint filed by him immediately after the occurrence.,ANALYSIS
1467,His explanation is that he was asked to sign on two blank papers by the police.,ANALYSIS
1468,"First of all, we see no reason why the police in a case of this nature would try to help the accused and shield the actual criminal.",ANALYSIS
1469,"Secondly, there is no material on record to show that PW1, the maternal uncle or PW 5, father of the deceased, ever complained to any authority that PW1 had been forced to sign two blank papers.",ANALYSIS
1470,This is a case where the maternal uncle and the father of the deceased had approached the High Court on at least two occasions for transfer of the investigation.,ANALYSIS
1471,"
They succeeded once and failed on the second occasion.",ANALYSIS
1472,"
In case the version of PW1 that his signatures were taken on blank papers was correct, then he would have definitely said so much earlier.",ANALYSIS
1473,He would have reported the matter to the higher authorities or made mention of this in the petitions filed in the High Court.,ANALYSIS
1474,Despite a pointed query to the counsel for the original complainant and the informant and the State they failed to point out whether any such complaint had been made by PW1 or PW5.,ANALYSIS
1475,"Therefore, we do not accept the version of PW1 that his signatures were obtained on blank sheets of papers.",ANALYSIS
1476,This also casts a doubt on the veracity of the statement of PW1.,ANALYSIS
1477,2. Delay in filing the private complaint  ,ANALYSIS
1478,"It is true that PW1 and PW5 were moving the High Court for transfer of the case to some other investigating agency but, at the same time, it would be pertinent to mention that after the chargesheet was filed against Venki by the Investigating Officer (DW4), neither PW1 nor PW5 filed any protest petition to the effect that the accused (appellants herein) should also be arraigned as accused.",ANALYSIS
1479,They let the matter go on and it was only after Venki died that the private complaint was filed.,ANALYSIS
1480,There is no explanation why no protest petition was filed when the police had only made out a case against accused Venki and that too under Section 304 IPC and not murder.,ANALYSIS
1481,3. PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the Court with clean hands  ,ANALYSIS
1482,The motive has been introduced after four years.,ANALYSIS
1483,The father and the maternal uncle of the deceased never brought up the issue of the deceased having conversations with R (PW10) at any earlier stage.,ANALYSIS
1484,"
           Therefore, PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the court with clean hands.",ANALYSIS
1485,They have cooked up the story of signing on blank papers and also cooked up the story relating to the motive.,ANALYSIS
1486,"Therefore, their evidence is not reliable and a person cannot be convicted on the basis of such evidence.",ANALYSIS
1487,15. All that is proved is that the deceased and the accused were sleeping in one room and the deceased died due to overdose of drug.,RATIO
1488,The prosecution had miserably failed to prove that the accused injected this drug.,RATIO
1489,"It is the case of the prosecution that the first injection was administered by Venki, which was only 4 ml.",RATIO
1490,There is possibility of the deceased injecting himself on the second occasion sometime in the middle of the night or early in the morning.,RATIO
1491,"In this context, we must remember that the doctor, who conducted the postmortem has not given any approximate time of death of the deceased which could have helped us in the matter.",RATIO
1492,The circumstances proved cannot lead to the inference that it is the accused alone who committed the offence.,RATIO
1493,"In fact, the prosecution has even failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death is homicidal in view of the inconsistencies in the medical evidence dealt by us above.",RATIO
1494,"Even otherwise, it is not proved that it was the accused who injected the deceased and the possibility of the accused injecting himself or some other person doing so cannot be ruled out.",RATIO
1495,"

1523,"The judgment of the trial court having been confirmed in appeal by the High Court of Allahabad, the two accused have filed this appeal by special leave of this Court.",RLC
1524,"The case of the prosecution is briefly as follows: on the morning of June 9, 1972 the deceased Ram Sanehi had gone to his field along with his son Bal Kishore and his daughter Kusuma Devi for eating Kharbuzas.",FAC
1525,"While they were returning from the field at about 9 a.m. the appellants, who were lying in wait near a culvert, suddenly accosted Ram Sanehi.",FAC
1526,"The Appeallent Subhash pointed the barred of his gun towards the chest of Ram Sanehi and said that since he, Ram Sanehi, was a witness against him in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal and since he was also doing Pairvi on behalf of Pooran Lal he would not be allowed to remain alive.",FAC
1527,The appellant Shyam Narain was armed     with a lathi.,FAC

 Before referring to the evidence in the case it has to be mentioned that the High Court had before it not only the appeal filed by the accused but also a reference made by the Sessions Court for confirma tion of the capital sentence under section 374 of the Code of CriminalProcedure.",ANALYSIS

From the long line of decisions which have taken this view it would be enough to refer to the decisions in Jumman and ors. v. The State of Punjab, Ram Shanker Singh & ors. v.
State of West Bengal and Bhupendra Singh v. The State of Punjab.
 ",PRE_RELIED
1548,The High Court has failed to show due regard to this well-established position in law.,ANALYSIS
1549,It did not undertake a full and independent examination of the evidence led in the case and it mainly contented itself with finding out whether the Sessions Court had in any manner erred in reaching the conclusion that the charge of murder levelled against the appellants was established beyond a reasonable doubt.,ANALYSIS
1550,The High Court is right in saying that the main question in the case was whether Bal Kishore and Kusuma Devi who were examined as eye-witnesses were truthful witnesses.,ANALYSIS
1551,But then it did not subject their evidence to any minute scrutiny.,ANALYSIS
1552,"
Impressed overbearingly by the circumstance that the Sessions Court ""had the opportunity of observing the demeanour"" of the witnesses, the High Court apparenty thought that such an opportunity gave to the Sessions Court's judgment a mystical weight and authority, even though the learned Sessions Judge had not, in his judgment or while recording the evidence, made any special reference to the demeanour of the witnesses.",ANALYSIS
1553,The High Court accepted the evidence of Ram Sanehi's children by observing that there was no material contradiction ill their evidence and that certain statements in the F.I.R. afforded a guarantee that the two witnesses were present when their father was done to death.,ANALYSIS
1554,We will now proceed to show how several significant circumstances either escaped the attention of the High Court or were not given their due and rightful importance.,ANALYSIS
1555,First as to the manner in which S.I. Sharma conducted investigation into the case.,ANALYSIS
1556,"The offence took place at about 9 a.m. on June 9 and though the District Hospital at Farrukaabad was just 10 miles away, the dead body was not received at the hospital for nearly 24 hours after the incident had taken place.",ANALYSIS
1557,The excuse offered by the prosecution that cartman was not willing to take the body at night is utterly flimsy because the Investigating officer could have easily made some alternate arrangement for despatchin the dead body for postmortem examination expeditiously.,ANALYSIS
1558,"With the dead body lying at the scene of offence for nearly 12 hours and thereafter at the police station for another 8 or 9 hours, it was easy enough for the witnesses to mould their statements so as to accord with the nature of injuries.",ANALYSIS
1559,The lnvestigating Officer did not make any note at all in the General Diary as to which witnesses were examined by him on the date of the occurrence which was obligatory upon him to do under paragraph 44 of the U.P. Police Act.,ANALYSIS
1560,"
The time when the investigation was commenced and the time when it was concluded are not mentioned in the case diary.",ANALYSIS
1561,"
The time when the Investigating officer reached the village and the time when he returned to the police station are also not noted in the case diary.",ANALYSIS
1562,S.I. Sharma stated in his evidence that several important facts concerning the investigation were being stated by him in his evidence from memory.,ANALYSIS
1563,"He reached the scene of offence at about 2-30 p.m.
but it was not until about 6 p.m. that he inspected the site.",ANALYSIS
1564,The dead body was not removed from the scene of offence till about 9 p.m. and even that is open to grave doubt because the Investigating officer has admitted in his evidence that he was unable to say as to when the dead body was taken way from the spot and whether it was taken directly to the hospital or was detained somewhere on the way.,ANALYSIS
1565,He was unable to say whether it was right or wrong that the dead body remained in the village till about 4 'O'clock on the morning of the 10th.,ANALYSIS
1566,Forty or fifty persons had gathered at the scene of offence when the Investigating officer arrived but the record of the case does not show that the statement of any of those persons was ever recorded.,ANALYSIS
1567,In fact even the statement of Kusuma Devi was recorded late at night for which the reason is stated to be that her elder sister Pushpa Devi died of shock on the evening of the 9th after hearing of her father's murder.,ANALYSIS
1568,"It may be that Pushpa Devi died on the 9th, but apart from the cause of her death, the statement of Kusuma Devi need not have been held up so long.",ANALYSIS
1569,We are doubtful if the Investigating officer at all knew on the 9th that Pushpa Devi had died.,ANALYSIS
1570,He has admitted that his knowledge in that behalf was derived from hearsay reports.,ANALYSIS

1572,"The Investigating officer did not even know of these significant developments, though they had taken place just a few miles away from the scene of investigation.",ANALYSIS
1573,He says that he learnt of the surrender and the arrest of the appellants on the evening of the 12th.,ANALYSIS
1574,"
Mangali Prasad has been examined by the prosecution as an eye-witness and his name is mentioned in the F.I.R. as one of the four persons who arrived at the scene of offence even before the appellants had run away.",ANALYSIS
1575,His statement was recorded 11 days later on June 20.,ANALYSIS
1576,The F.I.R. mentions expressly that the appellants caught hold of the legs of the deceased and started dragging him.,ANALYSIS
1577,The Investigating officer has not stated in the Panchnama of the scene of offence whether the ground was soft or hard or sandy which had great relevance on the allegation that the deceased was dragged over a certain distance.,ANALYSIS
1578,"Finally, it is surprising that the Investigating officer did not think it worthwhile to pay a visit to the field where the deceased is alleged to have gone with his children for eating Kharbuzas.",ANALYSIS
1579,"Indeed he stated that he was not in a position to say if there were Kharbuzas at all in the field, when the occurrence took place.",ANALYSIS
1580,"
         The High Court has condoned these lapses on the part of the Investigating officer with the observation that he ""appears to have been inexperienced and somewhat negligent"".
 ",ANALYSIS
1581,The Investigating officer has stated in his evidence that he had put in 7 years of service.,ANALYSIS
1582,It is difficult to understand on what basis the High Court attributed the lapses on his part to mere inexperience.,ANALYSIS
1583,"We will presently indicate the significance of the various lapses and loopholes in investigation but to say, as the High Court has done, that the Investigating Officer was ""somewhat negligent"" seems to us in the circumstances a grave euphemism.",ANALYSIS
1584,"
 We will now proceed to deal with the various circumstances which, in our opinion, render it unsafe to accept the prosecution case.",ANALYSIS
1585,"
 Dr. S.C. Pandiya who performed the post-mortem examination has described in his evidence the injuries received by Ram Sanehi.",ANALYSIS
1586,"In all he found 7 injuries on the dead body, out of which injuries 1, 3 and 7, injuries 2 and 4, and injuries 5 and 6 are interconnected.",ANALYSIS
1587,"Injury No. 1 is described as a ""shot wound"" with its entry above the left nipple.",ANALYSIS
1588,Injury No. 3 is described as multiple rounded abrasions on the left side of the chest.,ANALYSIS
1589,"Injury No. 7 is the wound of exit on the right scapular region, corresponding to injury No. 1.",ANALYSIS
1590,rnjury No. 2 consists of 8 gunshot wounds of entry below the right nipple while injury No. 4 consists of multiple rounded abrasions above the right nipple.,ANALYSIS
1591,Injury No. 5 is a gun-shot wound of entry on the back of the left forearm while injury No. 6 is the corresponding wound of exit near the ulnar aspect of the left forearm.,ANALYSIS
1592,"
 The evidence of Dr. Pandiya and the description of the injuries given by him in the post-mortem report tend to show that two different kinds of firearms were used by the assailants of Ram Sanehi.",ANALYSIS
1593,Injury No. 1 was caused by a bullet and that is clear not only from the description of the injury but from what Dr. Pandiya has stated in his evidence.,ANALYSIS
1594,"He says: ""The bullet, which had entered through injury No. 1 went out straight after emerging from injury No. 7"".",ANALYSIS
1595,Injuries Nos. 2 and 5 were caused by pellets.,ANALYSIS
1596,"This shows that whereas injury No. 1 was caused by a firearm in the nature of a rifle, injuries 2 and 5 were caused by an ordinary gun.",ANALYSIS
1597,"The medical evidence thus falsifies the eye- witnesses' account according to which, the appellant Subhash alone was armed with a double-barrelled gun, the other appellant Shyam Narain being armed with a lathi.",ANALYSIS
1598,"The objective inference arising from the nature of injuries received by the deceased has a significant impact on the case of the prosecution, which has been overlooked by both the Sessions Court and the High Court.",ANALYSIS
1599,"
 While we are on the medical evidence it would be appropriate to mention that there was no tatooing or charring on any of the firearm injuries which, according to the doctor, shows that the firing was done from a distance of more than 4 feet.",ANALYSIS
1600,"In the First Information Report Bal Kishore has stated that as soon as he, his father and sister, reached the culvert, Subhash ""touching the chest"" of Ram Sanehi ""with thebarrel of his gun"" said that he shall not leave him alive; Shyam Narain thereupon exhorted Subhash not to delay and fire immediately; Subhash then fired three shots in quick succession, one of which mishred.",ANALYSIS
1601,"The trend of the F.I.R. is that Subhash fired the first two shots at Ram Sanehi from a point blank range, in which event indisputably, there would have been tatooing and charring around the injuries.",ANALYSIS
1602,"Bal Kishore has attempted to offer an explanation that what he meant to say in his compaint was that Subhash trained his gun ""towards"" Ram Sanehi's chest and not ""on"" his chest.",ANALYSIS
1603,"
This explanation is an after thought and in the circumstances difficult to accept.",ANALYSIS
1604,"Thus in another important respect, the medical evidence falsifies the case of the prose cution.",ANALYSIS
1605,"
 There is another aspect of the medical evidence which, though, not as important as the two aspects mentioned above, may also be referred to.",ANALYSIS
1606,The case of the prosecution is that Ram Sanehi had gone to his Kharbuza field with his son and daughter for eating Kharobuzsas.,ANALYSIS
1607,There is evidence that they did eat Kharbuzas and almost immediately there after they started back for home.,ANALYSIS
1608,"Within less than 5 minutes, Ram Sanehi met with his deat near the culvert.",ANALYSIS
1609,The post-mortem report shows that Ram Sanehi's stomach was empty which means that the evidence that he had eaten Kharbuzas just a little time before his death is untrue.,ANALYSIS
1610,Bal Kishore tried to wriggle out of this situation by saying that Ram Sanehi had eaten just a small slice of Kharbuza.,ANALYSIS
1611,"But even there, Dr.
Pandiya has stated that if the entire slice of Kharbuza was eaten by Ram Sanehi, its remains would be found in the stomach provided there was no vomiting after the gun-shot injuries.",ANALYSIS
1612,"Since Ram Sanehi had not vomited, his large intestines could not have been found to be empty if the story of his children was true.",ANALYSIS
1613,"
 This last circumstance may at first sight seem trivial but its importance consists in the fact that the visit of Ram Sanehi, along with his children, to the Kharbuza field for the purpose of eating Kharbuzas is the very genesis of the incident which happened on June 9, 1972.",ANALYSIS
1614,"Coupled with the circumstance that the Investigating officer did not even pay a visit to the Kharbuza field, leave alone making a Panchnama thereof, the conclusion is irresistible that the story that the children had accompanied their father to the Kharbuza field lacks a factual basis.",ANALYSIS
1615,The other circumstances which render the prosecution case suspect are these (1) Ram Sanehi is alleged to have been drageed over 6 or 7 paces by the appellants but not even an abrasion was found on his back or stomach which could be attributed to dragging.,ANALYSIS
1616,(2) Thirty or forty persons are alleged to have collected at the sence of occurrence but Bal Kishore was not able to mention the name of even one of them and it is common ground that the Investigating officer did not record the statement of any of them.,ANALYSIS
1617,"(3) Jhabboo Singh, Shyam Lal Brij Bhushan and Mangali Prasad reached the scene of offence even before the appellants had fled away but none from amongst the first three was examined by the prosecution.",ANALYSIS
1618,Mangali Prasad was examined as an eye-witness but he has been concurrently disbelieved by the Sessions Court and the High Court.,ANALYSIS
1619,"(4) Though the motive of the offence is alleged to be that in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal against the appellant Subhash, the deceased Ram Sanehi was cited as a witness, Mangali Prasad's evidence shows that immediately after the firing, Bal Kishore told him that Ram Sanehi was murdered because of the disputes concerning the election to the Pradhanki.",ANALYSIS
1620,"What Bal Kishore told Mangali Prasad immediately after the incident seems more probable because, one Virendrapal had contested that election and the appellant Subhash had defeated him.",ANALYSIS
1621,"When Bal Kishore went to lodge his F.I.R. at the police station he was accompanied by Virendrapal, though an attempt was made to show that Virendrapal was only standing outside the police station and had met-Bal Kishore accidently.",ANALYSIS
1622,(5) The story of Bal Kishore that after the appellant Subhash fired 2 shots he re-loaded his gun but the re-loaded cartridge misured makes hardly any sense.,ANALYSIS
1623,"Subhash was armed with a double barrelled gun and having fired 2 fatal shots from a close range at his target, it is unlikely that he would re-load the gun and that too with only one cartridge.",ANALYSIS
1624,"And if that cartridge misfired, it is impossible to understand how it could be found concealed in the folds of Ram Sanehi's dhoti.",ANALYSIS
1625,"
 There is only one other aspect of the matter which remains to be considered and since the High Court has placed great reliance thereon, it is necessary to deal with it.",ANALYSIS
1626,"The F.I.R. which lodged at about 12 O'clock at noon on the 9th itself mentions that after Ram Sanehi was murdered, the appellant Subhash told his companion Shyam Narain that he himself was going to surrender before a court and that Shyam Narain should make his own arrangement.",ANALYSIS
1627,"In fact, Subhash did surrender in the court of the Additional District Magistrate, Farrukhabad, at about 4 p.m. on the 9th.",ANALYSIS
1628,What the High Court has over-looked is that Subhash did not surrender in connection with the murder of Ram Sanehi but he surrendered along with the 13 or 14 other accused against whom Pooran Lal had filed a complaint.,ANALYSIS
1629,"In so far as Shyam Narain is concerned, the High Court is wrong in saying that he managed somehow to get himself arrested.",ANALYSIS
1630,"The evidence of Constable Virendra Singh shows that Shyam Narain was arrested because he was crossing the railway lines and if he was not caught, he would have been run over by the two trains coming from Kanpur and Farrukhabad.",ANALYSIS
1631,"This was hardly any sensible way of making an ""arrangement"" for himself, as directed by Subhash.",ANALYSIS
1632,It is therefore not as if the statement attributed to Subhash in the F.I.R. is corroborated by subsequent events so as to afford a guarantee to Bal Kishore's presence at the culvert.,ANALYSIS
1633,"
 We are conscious that the Sessions Court and the High Court have both held that the appellants committed the murder of Ram Sanehi but the weight of the circumstances which we have discussed above is so preponderating that even the concurrent finding cannot be allowed to stand.",RATIO
1634,"In any event, it seems to us impossible to hold that the prosecution has established its case beyond a reasonable doubt.",RATIO
1635,"
 We therefore allow this appeal, set aside the order of conviction and sentence recorded by the High Court and the Sessions Court and direct that the appellants shall be set at liberty.

1669,"
 6.  To answer the first quesltion, for our consideration we may gainfully refer to the provisions of Section 222(1) which reads as under:- ""222(1) When an assessee is in default or is deemed to be in default in making a payment of tax, the Tax Recovery Officer may draw up under his signature a statement in the prescribed form specifying the amount of arrears due from the assessee (such statement being hereinafter in this Chapter and in the Second Schedule referred to as ""certificate"") and shall proceed to recover from such assessee the amount specified in the certificate by one or more of the modes mentioned below, in accordance with the rules laid down in the Second Schedule--- (a) attachment and sale of the assesee's movable property.",STA

 (b) attachment and sale of the assesee's immovable property; (c) arrest of the assessee and his detention in prison; (d) appointing a receiver for the management of the assessee's movable and immovable properties.",STA

 Explanation:- For the purposes of this sub-section, the assessee's movable or immovable property shall include any property which has been transferred, directly or indirectly on or after the 1st day of June, 1973, by the assessee to his spouse or minor child or son's wife or son's minor child, otherwise than for adequate consideration, and which is held by, or stands in the name of any of the persons aforesaid; and so far as the movable or immovable property so transferred to his minor child or his son's minor child is concerned, it shall, even after the date of attainment of majority by such minor child or son's minor child, as the case may be, continue to be included in the assessee's movable or immovable property for recovering any arrears due from the assessee in respect of any period prior to such date.""",STA
1672,"
 .  A perusal of the explanation on which reliance has been placed on behalf of the revenue, would contemplate that the movable or immovable property has been transferred directly or indirectly on or after the 1st day of June, 1973, by the assessee to his spouse or minor child or son's wife or son's minor child, otherwise than for adequate consideration, and which is held by, or stands in the name of any of the persons aforesaid; and so far as the movable or immovable property so transferred to his minor child or his son's minor child is concerned, it shall, even after the date of attainment of majority by such minor child or son's minor child, as the case may be, continue to be included in the assessee's movable or immovable property for recovering any arrears due from the assessee in respect of any period prior to such date.

1673,"It would be, therefore, clear that there must be a transfer of property on or after 1st June, 1973 in favour of the minor child.",ANALYSIS

1728,"
The Company also moved petitions in the High Court of Allahabad for writs quashing the three notices,. contending inter alia, that the notices issued more than four years after the expiry of the years of assessment were barred.",FAC
1729,"At the hearing of the petitions counsel for the Company conceded that under proviso (c) to s. 10 (2) (vi) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, in the form in which it stood in the assessment year 1956-57 and thereafter, excessive depreciation was in fact allowed to the Company.",FAC
1730,"It was also common ground that by virtue of cl. (c) to Explana-tion 1 of s. 147 of the Income-tax Act, 1961, income having been made the subject matter of excessive relief under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, the income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment.",FAC
1731,"But it was urged that the income had not escaped assessment ""by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly, all material facts necessary for assessment of that year"", for-(1) the Indian Income-tax Art, 1922, and the forms of returns prescribed under the rules did not require the, assessee to disclose that initial depreciation had been allowed in the earlier years; and (2) that in any event the Income-tax Officer knew that initial depreciation had been allowed to the Company in the years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53.",FAC
1732,"R. S. Pathak, J., who heard the petitions held that the Company committed no error in failing to take into account the initial depreciation while entering the written down value in column (2) of Part V of the return.",FAC
1733,But the learned Judge held that it was. incumbent upon the Company to inform the Income-tax Officer of all material facts necessary to make out its claim to depreciation and it was not open to the Company to set out only those facts which exaggerated its claim,FAC
1734,: the Company was bound to disclose all material facts which went to show what the true amount of the allowance to which it was entitled.,FAC
1735,The learned Judge accordingly rejected the petitions.,FAC
1736,"The order passed by Pathak, J., was confirmed in appeal under the Letters Patent.",FAC
1737,"By cl. (vi) of sub-s. (2) of s. 10 of the Income-tax Act, 1922, as amended by Act 8 of 1946, in computing the profits or gains.",STA
1738,"of business, profession or vocation carried on by him, an assessee was entitled to allowances not only of normal depreciation but also initial depreciation at the rates set out in cls. (a), (b) & (c) in respect of buildings which had been newly erected, or the machinery or plant being new had been installed after the 3 1st day of March, 1945.",FAC
1739,"It was, however, expressly enacted that the initial depreciation was not deductible in determining the written down value for the purpose of cl. (vi).",FAC
1740,Allowance for initial depreciation was therefore not to be taken into account in determining the written down value for determining the normal depreciation.,FAC
1741,But on that account proviso (c) to s. 10 (2) (vi) was not modified.,FAC
1742,"The written down value of the machinery of the, Company in the year 1956-57 was Rs. 16,48,053, but 'for the application of cl. (c) of the proviso to s. 10(2) (vi) the initial depreciation allowed in the years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952- 53 had to be taken into account.",FAC
1743,"The Income-tax Officer inadvertently failed to take into account the initial depreciation, and the Company was allowed normal depreciation in the year 1956-57 in excess of the amount permissible under proviso (c) to s. 10(2) (vi).",FAC
1744,TheIncome-tax Officer later sought to rectify the error and to bring to tax the income which had escaped tax.,FAC
1745,"
Before R. S. Pathak, I., it was contended that the definition of written down value"" in s. 10(5) (b) applies wherever the expression is used in s. 10(2) and on that account the Company in seting out the written down value in column (2) of Part V of the return was obliged to take into account all the depreciation actually allowed to it including the initial depreciation and as the Company computed the written down value only by deducting the normal depreciation and not the initial depreciation, it failed to' disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the purpose of assessment.",ANALYSIS
1746,This argument was not accepted by the learned Judge.,ANALYSIS
1747,"But he was still of the opinion that the Act imposed upon the Company a duty to disclose all material facts which went to show the true amount of the allowances to which it was entitled, and the Company by failing to disclose that initial depreciation had been allowed in three earlier years",ANALYSIS
1748,", the Company had failed to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment, and on that account s. 147 ( 1 )(a) was attracted and the, notice was properly issued.",ANALYSIS
1749,"
In appeal, the High Court observed that the ""only question for consideration"" was whether the Income-tax Officer was justified in issuing a notice under s. 148 of the Income-tax Act, 1961.",ANALYSIS
1750,"After stating that there was apparently ""a mistake and error on the side of the Company as well as the Income-tax Officer"", the, Court observed that the Income-tax Officer could reasonably comer to the conclusion that it was due to the omission and failure on the part of the assessee in disclosing fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment that the error was committed by the Income-tax Officer as a result of which some income had es- caped assessment.",ANALYSIS
1751,"The High Court then observed : ""It is difficult to hold that the Income-tax Officer while issuing the notices under Act could not reasonably hold the assessee was responsible for assessment."", and held that the notices were not Section 34(1) (a) of the Income-tax Act, 1922,",ANALYSIS

ACT:
Criminal Breach of Trust--Ingredients of--Common intention--
Meaning of--Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860), ss. 409, 34.

HEADNOTE:
The first appellant was the Managing Director and the second
appellant a Director and technical expert of a cloth dyeing
concern known as Parikh Dyeing and Printing Mills Ltd.",PREAMBLE
1864,"The
company entered into a contract with the Textile
Commissioner undertaking to dye a large quantity of cloth
which was supplied to the company for that purpose.",PREAMBLE
1865,"In
pursuance of the contract certain quantity of cloth was dyed
and delivered to the Textile Commissioner by the company but
it failed to dye and deliver the balance of cloth which
remained in its possession and was not returned to the
Textile Commissioner in spite of repeated demands.",PREAMBLE
1866,"
Ultimately the two appellants were prosecuted for criminal
breach of trust under S. 409 read with S. 34 of the Indian
Penal Code and were convicted for the same in a trial by
jury.",PREAMBLE
1867,"In appeal the High Court reviewed the evidence on the ground
of misdirection to the jury but found that the two
appellants were liable to account for the cloth over which
they had dominion, and having failed to do so each of them
was guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust.",PREAMBLE
1868,"The
High Court refused to accept the appellants' plea that the
cloth was old and was eaten up by white ants and moths.",PREAMBLE
1869,"On
appeal by the appellants by special leave:
Held, that to establish a charge of criminal breach of
trust, the prosecution was not bound to prove the precise
mode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by
the accused of the property entrusted to him or over which

he had dominion.",PREAMBLE
1870,"The principal ingredient of the offence of
criminal breach of trust being dishonest misappropriation
the mere failure of the accused to account for the property
entrusted to him might not be the foundation of his
conviction in all cases but where he was unable to account
and rendered an explanation for his failure which was
untrue, an inference of misappropriation with dishonest
intent might readily be made.",PREAMBLE
1871,"
The essence of liability under S. 34 of the Indian Penal
Code is the existence of a common intention animating the
offenders and the participation in a criminal act in
furtherance of the common intention.",PREAMBLE
1872,"The physical presence
at the scene of offence of the offender sought to be
rendered liable under S. 34 is not, on the words of the
statute, one of the conditions of its applicability in every
case.",PREAMBLE

1883,"J.--At a trial held with the aid of a common jury in Case No. 38 of the Vth Session 1955 before theAdditional Sessions Judge, City Court, Greater Bombay",RLC
1884,", the two appellants were convicted of offences under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code.",RLC
1885,The Additional Sessions Judge sentenced the first appellant to suffer rigorous imprisonment for five years and the second appellant to suffer rigorous imprisonment for four years.,RLC
1886,"
In appeal, the High Court of Bombay reviewed the evidence, because in the view of the Court, the verdict of the jury was vitiated on account of a misdirection on a matter of substantial importance, but held that the conviction of the two appellants for the offence under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code was, on the evidence, not liable to be set aside.",RLC
1887,The High Court accordingly confirmed the conviction of the two appellants but reduced the sentence passed upon the first appellant to rigorous imprisonment for three years and the sentence against the second appellant to rigorous imprisonment for one year.,RLC
1888,"Against the order of conviction and sentence, the appellants have appealed to this court with special leave.",FAC
1889,"
The facts which gave rise to the charge against the two appellants are briefly these: On June 15, 1948, the Textile Commissioner invited tenders for dyeing Pugree Cloth.",FAC
1890,"The Parikh Dyeing and Printing Mills Ltd., Bombay-hereinafter to be referred to as the company-of which the first appellant was the Managing Director and the second appellant was a Director and technical expert, submitted a tender which was accepted on July 27, 1948, subject to certain general and special conditions.",FAC
1891,"Pursuant to the contract, 2,51,059-3/4 yards of cloth were supplied to the company for dyeing.",FAC
1892,The company failed to dye the cloth within the stipulated period and there was correspondence in that behalf between the company and the Textile Commissioner.,FAC
1893,"Approximately 1,11,000. yards out of the cloth were dyed and delivered to the Textile Commissioner.",FAC
1894,"On March 25, 1950, the company requested the Textile Commissioner to cancel the contract and by his letter dated April 3, 1950, the Textile Commissioner complied with the request, and cancelled the contract in respect of 96,128 yards.",FAC
1895,"On November 20, 1950, the contract was cancelled by theTextile Commissioner in respect of the balance of cloth and the company was called upon to give an account without any further delay of the balance undelivered and it was informed that it would be held responsible for "" material spoiled or not accounted for "".",FAC
1896,"On December 4, 1950, the company sent a statement of account setting out the quantity of cloth actually delivered for dyeing, the quantity of cloth returned duly dyed and the balance of cloth, viz., 1,32,160 yards remaining to be delivered.",FAC
1897,"Against the cloth admitted by the company remaining to be delivered, it claimed a wastage allowance of 2,412 yards and admitted liability to deliver 1,29,748 yards lying with it on Government account.",FAC
1898,"
It appears that about this time, the company was in financial difficulties.",FAC
1899,"In December 1950, the first appellant left Bombay to take up the management of a factory in Ahmedabad and the affairs of the company were managed by one R. K. Patel.",FAC
1900,"In June 1952, an application for adjudicating the two appellants insolvents was filed in the Insolvency Court at Ahmedabad.",FAC
1901,An insolvency notice was also taken out against the two appellants at the instance of another creditor in the High Court at Bombay.,FAC
1902,Proceedings for winding up the company were commenced in the High Court at Bombay.,FAC
1903,"In the meantime, the mortgagee of the machinery and factory of the company had entered into possession under a covenant reserved in that behalf, of the premises of the factory of the company.",FAC
1904,The Textile Commissioner made attempts to recover the cloth remaining undelivered by the company.,FAC
1905,"A letter was posted by the Textile Commissioner on April 16, 1952, calling upon the company to deliver 51,756 yards of cloth lying with it in bleached condition to the Chief Ordnance Officer, Ordnance Depot,, Sewri, but the letter was returned undelivered.",FAC
1906,It was ultimately served with the help of the police on the second appellant in October 1952.,FAC
1907,"Thereafter on November 7, 1952, another letter was addressed to the company and the same was served on the second appellant on November 25, 1952.",FAC
1908,"By this letter, the company was reminded that 1,35,726-3/4 yards of clothwere lying with it on account of the government and the same had to be accounted for, and that the instructions to deliver 51,756 yards to the Chief Ordnance Officer, Ordnance Depot, Sewri, had not been attended to.",FAC
1909,"The Textile Commissioner called upon the company to send its representatives to "" clarify the position "" and to account for the material.",FAC
1910,"After receiving this letter, the second appellant attended at the office of the' Textile Commissioner and on November 27, 1952, wrote a letter stating that "" the main factors involved in not delivering the goods in finished state was that the material was very old "", was "" dhobibleached in different lots"", was ""
bleached under different conditions and therefore unsuitable for vat colour dyeing in heavy shades"", that it varied in length, weight, and finish and had "" lost affinity for vat colour dyeing"".",FAC
1911,"It was also stated that the company had in dyeing the basic material, suffered "" huge losses"" estimated at Rs. 40,000.",FAC
1912,"It was then stated: "" We are, therefore, however prepared to co-operate with the Government and are willing to make good the government's bare cost.",FAC
1913,"Please let us know the detail and the actual amount to be deposited so that we may do so at, an early date.",FAC
1914,"We shall thank you if we are given an appointment to discuss the matter as regards the final amount with respect to the balance quantity of the basic material.""",FAC
1915,"On December 29, 1952, the premises of the company and the place of residence of the appellants were raided, but no trace of the cloth was found.",FAC
1916,A complaint was then filed with the police charging the two appellants with criminal breach of trust.,FAC
1917,"in respect of 1,32,4041 yards of cloth belonging to the Government.",FAC
1918,"
There is no dispute that approximately 1,30,000 yards out of the cloth -entrusted to the company by the Textile Commissioner for dyeing has not been returned.",ANALYSIS
1919,"By its letter dated December 4, 1950, the company admitted liability to deliver 1,29,748 yards of cloth, but this cloth has not been returned to the Textile Commissioner in spite of repeated demands.",ANALYSIS
1920,"That the appellants, as directors of the company had dominion over that cloth was not questioned in, the trial court.",ANALYSIS
1921,The plea that there were other Directorsof the company besides the appellants who had dominion over the cloth has been negatived by the High Court and in our judgment rightly.,ANALYSIS
1922,"Direct evidence to establish misappropriation of the cloth over which the appellants had dominion is undoubtedly lacking, but to establish a charge of criminal breach of trust, the prosecution is not obliged to prove the precise mode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by the accused of the property entrusted to him or over which he has dominion.",ANALYSIS
1923,"The principal ingredient of the offence being dishonest misappropriation or conversion which may not ordinarily be a matter of direct proof, entrustment of property and failure in breach of an obligation to account for the property entrusted, if proved, may in the light of other circumstances, justifiably lead to -an inference of dishonest misappropriation or conversion.",ANALYSIS
1924,"
Conviction of a person for the offence of criminal breach of trust may not, in all cases, be founded merely on his failure to account for the property entrusted to him, or over which he has dominion, even when a duty to account is imposed upon him, but where he is unable to account or renders an explanation for his failure to account which is untrue, an inference of misappropriation with dishonest intent may readily be made.",ANALYSIS
1925,"
In this case, on a search of the factory on December 29, 1952, the cloth remaining to be delivered by the company was not found.",ANALYSIS
1926,"At the trial, the appellants sought to explain the disappearance of the cloth from the factory premises where it was stored, on the plea that it was old and was eaten up by white-ants and moths, and had been thrown away as rubbish.",ANALYSIS
1927,This plea of the appellants was not accepted by the High Court and we think rightly.,ANALYSIS
1928,"No information was given at any time to the Textile Commissioner after December 4, 1950, that the cloth had been eaten up by white-ants and moths, and was therefore thrown away or otherwise destroyed.",ANALYSIS
1929,"
Nor was any evidence led in support of the plea by the appellants.",ANALYSIS
1930,"
In this court, counsel for the first appellant contended that failure to return the cloth may give rise to a civil liability to make good the loss occasionedthereby, but in the circumstances of the case, the first appellant cannot be found guilty of the offence of criminal breach of trust.",ANALYSIS
1931,"Counsel submitted that the first appellant had left Bombay in 1950 and had settled down in Ahmedabad and was attending to a factory in that town, that thereafter the first appellant was involved in insolvency proceedings and was unable to attend to the affairs of the company in Bombay, and if, on account of the pre-occupation of the first appellant at Ahmedabad, he was unable to visit Bombay and the goods were lost, no criminal misappropriation can be attributed to him.",ANALYSIS
1932,But the case pleaded by the appellant negatives this submission.,ANALYSIS
1933,"The first appellant in his statement before the trial court admitted that he often went to Bombay even after he had migrated to Ahmedabad and-that he visited the mill premises and got the same opened by the Gurkha watchman and he found that the heap of cloth lying in the mill was getting smaller every time he visited the mill and on inquiry, he was told by the watchman that every day one basketful of sweepings was thrown away.",ANALYSIS
1934,"He also stated that he was shown several places in the compound of the factory where pits had been filled up with these sweepings, and that he found a small heap lying by the side of the ""
Tulsipipe gutter"" and also in the warehouses in the mill premises.",ANALYSIS
1935,"It is clear from this statement and other evidence on the record that even after he migrated to Ahmedabad, the first appellant was frequently visiting the factory at Bombay.",ANALYSIS
1936,"The evidence also discloses that meetings of Directors were held from time to time, but the minutes of the Directors' meetings have not been produced.",ANALYSIS
1937,"
The books of account-of the company evidencing disbursements to the Directors of remuneration for attending the meetings and the expenses for the alleged collection and throwing away of the sweepings have not been produced.",ANALYSIS
1938,"It is admitted by the first appellant that the letter dated November 27, 1952, was written by the second appellant under his instructions.",ANALYSIS
1939,"In his statement at the trial, the first appellant stated that he was informed of the letter dated November 26, 1952, from the Textile Commissioner and that he326 could not attend the office of that officer because he was busy attending to the insolvency proceedings and that he deputed the second appellant to attend the office and to explain and discuss the position.",ANALYSIS
1940,"Be then stated, ""We had informed the Commissioner that the company was prepared to pay for the cloth remaining after deducting the amount claimed as damages"".",ANALYSIS
1941,"The letter dated November 27, 1952, was evidently written under the direction of the first appellant and by that letter, liability to pay for the cloth after certain adjustments for losses alleged to be suffered by the company in carrying out the contract was admitted.
",ANALYSIS
1942,"By the letter dated December 4, 1950, liability to deliver the cloth was admitted and by the letter dated November 27, 1952, liability to pay compensation for the loss occasioned to the Government was affirmed.",ANALYSIS
1943,"The appellants who were liable to account for the cloth over which they had dominion have failed to do so, and they have rendered a false explanation for their failure to account.",ANALYSIS
1944,"The High Court was of the opinion that this false defence viewed in the light of failure to produce the books of account, the stock register and the complete absence of reference in the correspondence with the Textile Commissioner about the cause of disappearance established misappropriation with criminal intent.",ANALYSIS
1945,"
 Counsel for the first appellant contended that probably the goods passed into the possession of the mortgagees of the assets of the company.",ANALYSIS
1946,"but on this part of the submission, no evidence was led in the trial court.",ANALYSIS
1947,"Counsel for the first appellant, relying upon the observations in Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v. The State of Bombay (1), also contended that, in any event, a charge under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code cannot be established against the first appellant unless it is shown that at the time of misappropriation of the goods, the first appellant was physically present .",PRE_NOT_RELIED
1948,"But the essence of liability under s.34 is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the offenders leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of the (1) [1955] 1 S.C R. 1177.common intention and presence of the offender sought to be rendered liable under s. 34 is not, on the words of the statute, one of the conditions of its applicability.",PRE_NOT_RELIED
1949,As explained by Lord Sumner in Barendra Kumar Ghose v. The King Emperor(') the leading feature of s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code is 'participation' in action.,PRE_RELIED
1950,"To establish joint responsibility for an offence, it must of course be established that a criminal act was done by several persons; the participation must be in doing the act, not merely in its planning.",PRE_NOT_RELIED
1951,A common intention--a meeting of minds--to commit an offence and participation in the commission of the offence in furtherance of that common intention invite the application of s. 34.,PRE_NOT_RELIED
1952,But this participation need not in all cases be by physical presence.,ANALYSIS
1953,"In offences involving physical violence, normally presence at the scene of offence of the offenders sought to be rendered liable on the principle of joint liability may be necessary, but such is not the case in respect of other offences where the offence consists of diverse acts which may be done at different times and places.",ANALYSIS
1954,"In Shree Kantiah's case (supra), misappropriation was committed by removing goods from a Government depot and on the occasion of the removal of the goods, the first accused was not present.",PRE_NOT_RELIED
1955,"It was therefore doubtful whether he had participated in the commission of the offence, and this court in those circumstances held that participation by the first accused was not established.",PRE_NOT_RELIED
1956,"The observations in Shree Kantiah's case (supra) in so far as they deal with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code must, in our judgment, be read in the light of the facts established and are not intended to lay down a principle of universal application.",PRE_NOT_RELIED
1957,"
The High Court has found that the two appellants were liable to account for the cloth over which they had dominion and.
they failed to account for the same and therefore each had committed the offence of criminal breach of trust.",ANALYSIS
1958,"The High Court observed: "" In such a case, if accused Nos. 1 and 2 (Appellants 1 & 2) alone were concerned with the receipt of the goods, if they were dealing with the goods all the time, if they were receiving communications from the Textile Commissioner's office and sending replies, to (1) [1924] L.R. 52 I.A. 40, 52.them, and if the part played by each of them is apparent from the manner in which they are shown to have dealt with this contract, then it is a case of two persons entrusted with the goods and a breach of trust obviously being committed by both of them'.
",ANALYSIS
1959,It was submitted that the High Court erred in finding the appellants guilty of offences under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code when the charge framed against them was one under s. 409 read with s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code.,ANALYSIS
1960,"A charge framed against the accused person, referring to s. 34 is but a convenient form of giving notice to him that the principle of joint liability is sought to be invoked.",ANALYSIS
1961,Section 34 does not create an offence; it merely enunciates a principle of joint liability for criminal acts done in furtherance of the common intention of the offenders.,ANALYSIS
1962,"Conviction of an accused person recorded, relying upon the principle of joint liability, is therefore for the offence committed in furtherance of the common intention and if the reasons for conviction establish that the accused was convicted for an offence committed in furtherance of the common intention of himself and others, a reference in the order recording conviction to s. 34 of the Indian Penal Code may appear to be asurplusage.",ANALYSIS
1963,The order of the High Court recording the conviction of the appellants for the offence under s. 409 of the Indian Penal Code is therefore not illegal.,ANALYSIS
1964,"
It was submitted for the first appellant that the sentence passed against him was unduly severe, and that, in any event, no distinction should have been made between him and the second appellant in the matter of sentence.",ANALYSIS
1965,It is evident on the findings accepted by us that property of considerable value has been misappropriated by the first appellant.,ANALYSIS
1966,"He was the Managing Director of the company an& primarily, he had dominion over the property entrusted to the company.",ANALYSIS
1967,"The second appellant was, though a Director, essentially a technician.",ANALYSIS
1968,"Having regard to these circumstances, if the High Court has made a distinction between the two appellants, we ought not to interfere with the sentence, which by itself cannot be said to be excessive.",RATIO

HEADNOTE:
The appellant declared for the assessment years 1959-60 a

of safety matches and claimed exemption on the entire
turnover on the ground that it was a subsequent sale from

operandi of the appellant in purchasing these matches was
that it placed orders with the sales depots of the
manufacturers inside Mysore.",PREAMBLE

forwarded the orders to the principles who has their head
office at Sivakasi outside the State of Mysore.",PREAMBLE

voices of the matches despatched by their factories.",PREAMBLE
1978,"The
appellant gave credit to the value of the matches after
deducting therefrom the amount covered by debit notes in
respect of Octroi, lorry freight and other incidental
charges incurred by it and at the request of the sales
office the appellant remitted the value of the matches

transfer.",PREAMBLE
1979,"The appellant's contention was that it purchased
the matches from the sales depots inside Mysore State who

2007,"On these findings the correctness of which was not disputed the assessing authority came to the conclusion that the transactions were inter-State sales within the meaning of 'Sec. 3 (a) of the Central Sales Tax Act and since the appellant was the first dealer in matches in Mysore State it was liable to pay Sales Tax and accordingly, it was so assessed.",FAC
2008,Against the said assessment order the appellant filed an appeal to the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes who dismissed the appeal.,FAC
2009,The further appeal to the Tribunal was equally unsuccessful.,FAC
2010,"
Before us it is contended by the learned Advocate for the appellant relying upon the despatch advice, delivery notes and invoices issued in the name of the assessee in which the Sales Tax @ 2% was charged that the sale by the manufacturer at Sivakasi was effected in favour of their respective sales Depots in Mysore and it is only thereafter that the appellants purchased from these Sales Depots the matches and cannot therefore be treated as the first purchaser in the Mysore State.",ARG_PETITIONER
2011,"It appears to us on the facts as set out above which were not in dispute, the sales were made by the respective factories direct to the appellant, the sales price was also sent directly to the factories at Sivakasi.",ANALYSIS
2012,"
No doubt the orders were routed through the Sales Depot but on that account it cannot be said that the factory sold the goods ordered by the appellant to its Sales Depot.",ANALYSIS
2013,It does not appear that the content-ion based on the invoices showing that the Sales Tax was charged by the Sales Depot was urged before any of the authorities or before the High Court nor was there any finding on this aspect as is evident from the facts found by the Sales Tax authorities which were not in dispute.,ANALYSIS
2014,It is also inconceivable that there can be a sale between the manufacturer and its Sales Depot.,ANALYSIS
2015,"
It is not disputed that under the provisions of the Act it is the first sale in the State that is exigible to tax.",ANALYSIS
2016,"
Sale is defined in sec. 2(t) of the Act as follows: - ""Sale' with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means every transfer of the property in goods by one person to another in the course of tradeor business for cash or for deferred payments or other valuable consideration, but does not include a mortgage hypothecation, charge or pledge"".
Explanation (3) to this definition which is relevant is given below:- (a) The sale or purchase of goods shall be deemed for the purpose of this Act, to have taken place in the State wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made, if the goods are within the State (I) In the case of specific or ascertained goods, at the time the contract or sale or purchase is made; and (II) in the case of unascertained or future goods, at the time of their appropriation to the contract of sale or purchase by the seller or by the purchaser, whether the assent of the other party is prior or subsequent to such appropriation"".",STA
2017,"
It is apparent from the above provisions that the transactions in question under explanation 3(a) are the first sales in favour of the appellant and they took place within the State of Mysore.",ANALYSIS
2018,"The learned advocate relies on the decision in Ram Narain & Sons v. The Assistant Commissioner of Sales-Tax & Others(1), for the contention that in similar circumstances the sale was said to have been affected to the depots and consequently the sale to the assessee was the second sale and is, therefore, not assessable to tax.",PRE_NOT_RELIED
2019,"The High Court, before which this decision was cited, did not rely upon it because it felt that it was not possible to ascertain whether under the statute this Court was called upon to consider the definition of sale similar to that contained in section 2 (t) of the Act.",PRE_NOT_RELIED
2020,"It is true that in that case while this Court was considering the question whether the sales were inter-State sales or inside sales, the definition of 'sale' under the Madhya Pradesh Sales Tax Act was not specifically referred to or examined.",ANALYSIS
2021,"A perusal of that decision, however, would show that what this Court was considering was whether the transactions fell within the definition of sale contained in explanation 11 to section 2(g) of the Madhya Pradesh Sales Tax Act and that so far as the post-Cons- titution period was concerned, whether they were saved from the ban of Article 286(1) (a) and the explanation thereto, by the President's order made under the proviso to Article 286(2).",ANALYSIS
2022,"The Advocate General of Madhya Pradesh, no doubt, urged that the (1) [1955] (2) S.C.R. 483.transactions were pure inside sales entered into by the assessees in Madhya Pradesh on orders received by them from outside the State, and accepted by the petitioners in that State.",ANALYSIS
2023,"It was also contended that the goods were appropriated to the contracts, and the property in the goods passed within the State of Madhya Pradesh, as such the sales were inter-State sales or inside sales which, it was within the competence of the State of Madhya Pradesh to tax.",ANALYSIS
2024,The facts disclosed that the assessees manufactured beedis in Madhya Pradesh.,ANALYSIS
2025,They had various sales depots in U.P. and other State and also had selling agents through whom they sold their goods.,ANALYSIS
2026,Apart from affecting sales through the said agencies.,ANALYSIS
2027,they also sold direct to customers who placed orders with them.,ANALYSIS
2028,"The question was whether some or all of those sales took place in Madhya Pradesh or in U.P. and it was held that having regard to the transactions in respect of all the aforesaid categories of sales, they were affected in U.P.",RATIO
2029,We are unable to appreciate how this case really assists the appellants.,RATIO
2030,"On the other hand, it would appear that the sale by the assessee was affected in U.P., which if applied to the facts in this case, would indicate that the first sale by the Sivakasi firms was in Mysore.",RATIO
2031,"In that view, the question of inter-State sale not being urged as necessary for consideration, it was rightly held by the High Court that the sales in question fell within clause (a) of explanation (3) of section 2(t) of the Act; as such this appeal is dismissed but in the circumstances, without costs.",RPC

2089,"It may be noted that exemption both under s. 4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and under s.10(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was given to the members of certain scheduled tribes.",ANALYSIS

 It is not in dispute that taxation laws must also pass the test of Art. 14.",ANALYSIS
2095,That has been laid down by this Court in Moopil Nair v. State of Kerala(1).,PRE_RELIED
2096,"But as observed by this Court in East India Tobacco Co. v. State of Andhra Pradesh(2), in deciding whether a taxation law is discriminatory or not it is necessary to bear in mind that the State has a wide discretion in selecting persons or objects it will tax, and that a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others; it is only when within the range of its selection, the law operates un- (1) [1961] 3 S.C.R. 77.

2104,Is there any legal basis for this differentiation ?,ANALYSIS
2105,Prima facie it appears that the government servants have been discriminated against and the discrimination in question is writ large on the face of the provisions in question.,ANALYSIS
2106,"
 The learned Solicitor-General contended that the classification in question can be justified on administrative grounds.",ARG_PETITIONER
2107,He urged that a classification based on administrative convenience is a just classification in the matter of levying taxes.,ARG_PETITIONER
2108,According to him it is easy to collect taxes from government servants.,ARG_PETITIONER
2109,"Therefore, it was permissible for the legislature to deny them the exemption extended to the other members of their tribes.",ARG_PETITIONER
2110,"
 This contention appears to be without merit.",ANALYSIS
2111,It may be that for the purpose of taxation a classification can be made on the basis of administrative convenience.,ANALYSIS
2112,But we fail to see how the case of the government servants stands on a footing different from that of the employees in statutory corporations or even well recognised firms.,ANALYSIS
2113,"That apart, administrative convenience which can afford  just basis for classification must be a real and substantial one.",ANALYSIS
2114,We see no such administrative convenience.,ANALYSIS
2115,"The learned Solicitor-General, next contended that 'the classification can be justified on the basis of past legislative practice and history.",ARG_PETITIONER
2116,"In this connection he invited our attention to the fact that before this country got independence, the income of the persons in the service of the government 'but serving outside British India such as in Baluchistan, or native States was subject to tax under the Indian Income Tax laws though other persons residing in those places were not subject to the income tax laws in force in British India.",ARG_PETITIONER
2117,"
 The L10 Sup C1/67-12 reason for the same is that the Indian legislature had no.
 legislative competence to tax the residents of those areas, but it had competence to tax the income of the persons in government service though they might be serving outside British India.",ARG_PETITIONER
2118,"
 The learned Solicitor-General next invited our attention to a notification issued by the Government of India as long back as 6-6-1890, under which the income earned by members of certain scheduled tribes other than those serving under the government was exempted from income tax.",ARG_PETITIONER
2119,"He also invited our attention to Finance department Notification No.
 788F dated 21-3-1922 under which the income of indigenous hill men other than persons in the service of government, residing in certain areas were exempt from tax.",ARG_PETITIONER
2120,"On the basis of those notifications, he wanted us to spell out a well recognised legislative practice and history under which the government servants as a class were excluded from the benefit of income tax exemption extended to other persons similarly situated.",ARG_PETITIONER
2121,"In this connection, he placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Narottam Kishore Dev Varma and Ors. v. Union of India and another(1).",ARG_PETITIONER
2122,Therein this Court was called upon to consider the validity of s. 87B of the Code of Civil Procedure which prescribed that a Ruler of a former Indian State cannot be sued in any court otherwise competent to try the suit except with the consent of the Central Government certified in writing by a Secretary to the Government.,ARG_PETITIONER
2123,The validity of that provision was challenged on the basis of Art. 14.,ARG_PETITIONER
2124,"This Court upheld the. validity of that provision having regard to the legislative and historical background of that provision, but at the same time observed that considered in the light of basic principles of equality before law, it would be odd to allow the section to continue prospectively for all time to come.",ARG_PETITIONER
2125,"After setting out the legislative background of that provision, this Court observed: ""The legislative background to which we have referred cannot be divorced from the historical background which is to be found for instance, in Art. 362.",ARG_PETITIONER
2126,"This Article provides that in the exercise of the power of Parliament or of any legislature of any State to make laws or in the exercise of the executive power of the Union or of a State, due regard shall be had to the guarantee or assurance given under any such covenant or agreement as is referred to in clause (1) of Art. 291 with respect to the personal rights, privileges and dignities of a Ruler of an Indian State.",ARG_PETITIONER
2127,This has reference to the covenants and agreements which had been entered into between the Central Government and the Indian Princes before all the Indian States were politi- (1) [1964] 7 S.C.R. 55.                         cally completely assimilated with the rest of India.,ARG_PETITIONER
2128,The privilege conferred on the Rulers of former Indian States has its origin in these agreements and covenants.,ARG_PETITIONER
2129,One of the privileges is that of extra territoriality and exemption from civil jurisdiction except with the sanction of the Central Government.,ARG_PETITIONER
2130,"It was thought that the privilege which was claimed by foreign Rulers and Rulers of Indian States prior to the independence of the country should be continued even after independence was attained and the States had become part of India, and that is how in 1951, the Civil Procedure Code was amended and present sections 86, 87, 87A and 87B came to be enacted in the present form.""",ARG_PETITIONER
2131,"
In the background set out above this Court upheld the validity of s. 87B of the Code of Civil Procedure.",ANALYSIS
2132,"
       We know of no legislative practice. or history treating the government servants as a separate class for the purpose of income tax.",ANALYSIS
2133,The government servants' income has all along been treated in the same manner as the income of other salaried officers.,ANALYSIS

2138,At the time those notifications were issued the power of the legislature to grant or withhold any exemption from tax was not subject to any constitutional limitation.,ANALYSIS
2139,Hence the validity of the impugned provisions cannot be tested from what our legislatures or governments did or omitted to do before the Constitution came into force.,ANALYSIS
2140,"If that should be considered as a true test then Art. 13(1) would become otiose and most, if not all, of our constitutional guarantees would lose their content.",ANALYSIS
2141,Sri Setalvad learned counsel for the respondent is justified in his comment that classification based on past legislative practice and history does not mean that because in the past the legislature was enacting arbitrary laws it could do so now.,ANALYSIS
2142,"
 It was the contention of the learned Solicitor-General that exemption from income tax was given to members of certain scheduled tribes due to their economic and social backwardness; it is not possible to consider a government servant as socially and economically backward and hence the exemption was justly denied to him.",ARG_PETITIONER
2143,"According to the Solicitor-General, once a tribal becomes a government servant he is lifted out of his social environment and assimilated into the forward sections of the society and therefore he needs no. more any crutch to lean on.",ARG_PETITIONER

 It was lastly contended by the learned Solicitor-General a contention which was not taken either in the return or before the High Court or in the appeal memo.- that it is not possible to strike down only a portion of s.
4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act. 1922 and s. 10(26) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, namely, the words ""provided that such member is not in the service of government"" found in s. 4(3)(xxi) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 and the words ""who. is not in, the1 service of government"" in s.

 7.    The learned defence counsel vehemently urged that when the plastic jar was not produced in the court, when chemical test was not done when SI has not made any test at the spot, neither he nor the S.I is an expert to test the liquor, more over when in no form the liquid was examined by him, when there is no malakhan entry for the seized material when no batch of the seized articles was specified on the charge sheet when no conscious possession of contraband by the accused is proved.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2194,No seizure list was examined by the prosecution and no independent witness has supported the prosecution to prove the same.,ARG_RESPONDENT
2195,It is further argued that the only witness examined by the prosecution is the official witness and to appreciate the evidence of official witness great care has to be given by the court.,ARG_RESPONDENT
2196,Hence it is found that prosecution has significantly failed to prove its case beyond all reasonable doubt against the accused and as such the case is entitled for a clear acquittal controvert the submission of the defence counsel the learned APP submitted that none prosecution of the seized article in the court and none examination of the independent witness is not fatal for prosecution.,ARG_RESPONDENT

2199,It is settled in law that such type of cases have to prove beyond all suspicion that is the liquid is seized from exclusive & conscious possession of the accused and the liquid is nothing but ID liquor.,ANALYSIS
2200,For proving the first point that is conscious possession of the contraband I had examined the evidence of P.Ws.1 who has stated that the liquor was seized from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.,ANALYSIS
2201,But no independent witness has support the prosecution to prove the same.,ANALYSIS

2225,"Accused No.3 who is said to be the mother of accused Nos.1 and 2 abetted the said act and it is also alleged that accused No.2 actively participated in the commission of the offence and therefore having caused grievous injuries, on the complaint lodged by PW-4, a case was registered for the offences punishable under Sections 341, 326, 307 and 109 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.

 ""(i) Whether the prosecution has proved beyond all reasonable doubt by adducing cogent and reliable evidence stating that on 10-3-2007 at about 8.30 a.m. in the land Sy.No.91 of Koralli the accused in furtherance of their common intention wrongfully restrained C.W.2- Sharanappa to proceed in the direction in which he has right to proceed, the accused caused grievous injuries to C.W.2-Sharanappa by assaulting him from Talwar and knife and have attempted to commit the murder of C.W.2- Sharanappa by assaulting him with Talwar and axe and accused No.3 abetted accused No.1 and 2 in the commission of the said offence and thereby the accused have committed the offence punishable under Sections 341, 326, 307 and 109 R/w. Section 34 of Indian Penal Code?
 (ii) What order?""",ISSUE
2230,"
 4. The background to the alleged offence committed by the accused was that the complainant's father had three brothers namely, Gurushantappa, Ranojappa and Kupendra.",FAC
2231,"Kupendra was said to be no more and the family owned lands bearing Survey Number 91, 94, and 95 of Koralli village.",FAC
2232,Gurushantappa had divided the land between himself and his brothers.,FAC
2233,"
 Gurushantappa's sons namely Ratanchand and Mallikarjun were quarreling amongst themselves in connection with land bearing Survey No.91 to the effect that the complainant did not have any share in the land and had called upon him not to cultivate the land and they had also instituted proceedings before the office of the Deputy Commissioner as regards their claim in respect of the land.
But however, the complainant was said to be cultivating the land throughout and therefore he negated the objection raised by the sons of Gurushantappa and had grown sugar cane in the said land and the brother of the complaint namely Sharanappa had obtained permission to supply sugar cane to the Bhusnoor sugar factory and had arranged for harvesting the sugar cane crop.",FAC
2234,"On 09.03.2007 labourers had been engaged to harvest the sugar cane crop and when the operations were on, at about 8.30 a.m. on 10.03.2007 the complainant had visited the land and at that point he saw his brother Sharanappa and his son Hanumantharaya were at the land and Ratanchand and Mallikarjun were armed with an axe and a knife and they were all quarreling.",FAC
2235,"Mallikarjun and Ratanchand were questioning Sharanappa and his nephew Hanumantharaya, as to what right they had to harvest the sugar cane and thereafter had proceeded to attack them.",FAC
2236,"Ratanchand had assaulted Sharanappa with the sword on his right palm, as a result of which his thumb was said to have been severed from his hand and when the complainant and Hanumantharaya tried to intervene, the accused, it is alleged had pushed them to the ground and continued to assault Sharanappa on his left shoulder and thereby caused grievous injuries.",FAC
2237,"The accused Ratanchand once again is said to have assaulted Sharanappa on the left side of his hand and neck, as a result of which he fell to the ground.",FAC
2238,"Thereafter, the accused are said to have left the place on the assumption that Sharanappa was dead.",FAC
2239,"There was a jeep standing by, belonging to one Babu Kalashetty on which the accused are said to have fled.",FAC
2240,"It is further alleged that accused No.3 who was also present on the land, exhorted accused Nos.1 and 2 to attack Sharanappa and kill him.",FAC
2241,In the meanwhile the complainant and Hanumantharaya had brought a private jeep and thereafter they had carried Sharanappa to a Government Hospital at Aland and admitted him for treatment.,FAC
2242,"It is thereafter that the Police Sub-Inspector, Aland has visited the hospital at about 10.00 a.m. and recorded the statement of the complainant and registered a case.",FAC
2243,"After further investigation and after gathering other material objects, recording statements of other witnesses and after completion of proceedings, the matter was committed to the Sessions Court.",FAC
2244,"
 5. It is in this background that the Court below after having found that though it could not be denied that PW-1 had suffered serious injuries, the evidence in support of the alleged charges against the accused was the evidence of PWs-1, 4, 5 and 9.",ANALYSIS
2245,It was found that PW-1 categorically denied the presence of accused No.3 and consequently he had stated in his evidence that accused No.1 assaulted him with an axe and accused No.2 assaulted him with a sword but contrary to this PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that accused No.1 assaulted Sharanappa with an axe and accused No.2 assaulted him with a sword.,ANALYSIS
2246,"Further, PW-1 in his evidence had stated that he was alone on the land but contrary to this PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that they were also present on the land at the time of the incident and that when they tried to intervene, to rescue Sharanappa, the accused No.1 threatened them and pushed them away.",ANALYSIS
2247,"Therefore, the Court below has seriously doubted the very presence of PW-4 and PW-5 in view of the contradictory statements and coming from the mouth of PW-1 the injured witness.",ANALYSIS
2248,"The Court below has also contemplated that if really PWs-4 and 5 were also present on the land and tried to rescue Sharanappa from the accused who were armed with a sword and an axe as alleged, it is difficult to understand as to how they had not sustained any injuries.",ANALYSIS
2249,6. Further it was also in the evidence of PWs-4 and 5 that they carried Sharanappa to hospital in a jeep and that he was heavily bleeding and their clothes were also blood stained but interestingly the Investigating Officer had not thought it fit to seize those blood stained clothes.,ANALYSIS
2250,"Further, PW-1 in his evidence has stated that at the time of incident there were 20 labourers engaged in harvesting the sugar cane crop.",ANALYSIS
2251,"However, the Investigating Officer had not made any attempt to record the statement of those witnesses who were the best witnesses to speak about the incident, as they would have been totally independent witnesses.",ANALYSIS
2252,"That if really such an offence had been committed, as alleged in the complaint and as stated by PWs-4 and 5, the labourers who were working in the field would have witnessed the incident.",ANALYSIS
2253,"Therefore, in the absence of any such independent evidence on record, the testimony of the said witnesses has been characterized as being tutored and interested testimony, especially, when there are material contradictions as regards the weapons seized and the manner in which the same have stated to have been employed by the accused in assaulting the injured and which is contradictorily stated by the said witnesses.",ANALYSIS
2254,"7. Further, PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that immediately after the incident they carried Sharanappa first to the police station and thereafter to the hospital.",ANALYSIS
2255,But the evidence of the Investigating Officer discloses that after he was informed of the incident he had come to the hospital and recorded the statement of the complainant.,ANALYSIS
2256,"
This is yet another contradiction which has been disbelieved by the Court as to the manner in which the incident may have occurred.",ANALYSIS
2257,"
Apart from these witnesses, there were other witnesses such as PW- 9 who was a circumstantial witness of the incident and the evidence of that witness was also of no help to the prosecution.",ANALYSIS
2258,"8. Similarly, PW-6 who was the father of PW-1 had deposed that he was in his house at the time of the incident and when he visited the land, PW-1 had already been carried to the hospital for treatment and in this manner the Court below has discarded the evidence of this witness, apart from PWs-10, 12 and 14 who were all formal witnesses in respect of the panchanama and spot mahazar etc.",ANALYSIS
2259,"In fact PWs-12 and 14 who are the panch witnesses and seizure mahazar, have not supported the prosecution case and they were treated as hostile witnesses.",ANALYSIS
2260,"9. Further, the Court below has discussed the evidence of PW- 3, the Medical practitioner of the Government Hospital, Aland, who had stated that Sharanappa was brought by one Nagappa for treatment and that he had been assaulted with an axe and a knife and the doctor has spoken about the serious injuries which were identified as seven in number and that the patient was shifted to a larger hospital as the injuries were very grievous in nature.",ANALYSIS
2261,"Though the medical evidence clearly indicated that the victim had suffered grievous injuries, the evidence of the other witnesses was not consistent in the manner as to how those injuries were caused.",ANALYSIS
2262,10. PW-1 deposed that there was a property dispute between his father and father of accused No.1.,ANALYSIS
2263,"He has narrated that accused No.1 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm, as a result of which the thumb got severed and accused No.2 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm and also on the wrist of his left hand and accused No.1 repeated his assault with the axe on the left portion of his chest, thereafter he had lost consciousness.",ANALYSIS
2264,"He had further stated that when accused Nos.1 and 2 had attacked him, there was none present on the land and that at the time of the incident accused No.3 was carrying water to her house.",ANALYSIS
2265,"However, in his cross- examination he had denied that accused No.3 was present at all.",ANALYSIS
2266,"
On which he was treated as a hostile witness and the prosecution has cross-examined him on that aspect.",ANALYSIS
2267,"
 11. PW-5 who is the son of PW-1 had stated that accused No.1 had assaulted PW-1 on his right palm with the sword as a result of which the thumb was severed and he and PW-4 intervened.
Accused No.2 had threatened him with the axe thereafter accused No.2 continued to assault his father with an axe on the left hand causing injuries.",ANALYSIS
2268,Accused No.2 also caused injury on the left shoulder and thereafter he had lost consciousness.,ANALYSIS
2269,That accused No.3 was all along exhorting accused Nos.1 and 2 to murder Sharanappa.,ANALYSIS
2270,"
 12. Given these inconsistencies in the case of the prosecution, though it cannot be denied that PW-1 had suffered serious injuries, since the manner in which the incident had unfolded and the participation of the accused, as alleged, being inconsistently narrated by the witnesses, the trial Court has rightly felt that it was not possible to reconcile the inconsistencies and contradictions and therefore has held that prosecution has failed to bring home the charges beyond all reasonable doubt as against the accused and has acquitted them.",ANALYSIS
2271,"Though the learned Additional Advocate General would make an effort to salvage the case, as could be seen from the evidence tendered, it is full of inconsistencies which cannot be reconciled and the trial Court has rightly acquitted the accused on the grounds as stated.",RATIO

2313,"According to this witness, he had conducted blue litmus paper test which turned into red in colour, conducted hydrometer test and thereafter prepared the seizure list.",ANALYSIS
2314,Another official witness PW 1 (Excise constable) like wise supported the version of P.W 2 in respect of patrolling and seizure of the liquor from the possession of the accused.,ANALYSIS
2315,Specific version of both the witnesses is that seizure was conducted by the SI of Excise in presence of the witnesses.,ANALYSIS
2316,"Hence, it is necessary to testify the testimony of the official witnesses from independent source for the sake of corroboration.",ANALYSIS
2317,"P.W. 3, the independent seizure witness did not support the version of P.W. 2 at all in respect of factum of seizure.",ANALYSIS
2318,According to him nothing was seized in his presence by any Excise staff and he has put his thumb impression on a paper.,ANALYSIS
2319,Hence there is discrepancy between the testimony of independent seizure witness and the official witnesses.,ANALYSIS
2320,"
 7. To prove an offence U/s.47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act, it is the bounden duty of prosecution to establish that the seizure was from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.",ANALYSIS
2321,But in this case the seizure witness did not support the factum of seizure at all.,ANALYSIS
2322,"Further the SI of Excise, PW 2 in cross-examination admitted that he had not known the accused prior to the incident.",ANALYSIS
2323,The spot is a village road and busy one.,ANALYSIS
2324,He further deposed that he has not produced the seized articles before the court nor he sent the same for chemical examination.,ANALYSIS
2325,"Though the independent corroboration is not the rule but as the place of seizure is a public place, examination of independent witness is necessary to make the judgment free from any criticism.",ANALYSIS
2326,The plea of the defence is that a false case has been foisted against him only for statistical purpose.,ANALYSIS
2327,"There is no material on record to show the exact place of seizure, as no sketch map is prepared or proved by the prosecution in this case to establish that the seizure was from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.",ANALYSIS
2328,"
 More so the SI of Excise neither produced the seized liquor before the court nor sent the same for chemical examination.",ANALYSIS
2329,"Further, independent seizure witness did not support the factum of seizure.",ANALYSIS
2330,In such premises I hold that the prosecution failed to prove the factum of seizure from the possession of the accused for want of independent corroboration.,ANALYSIS
2331,Hence the prosecution failed to establish the seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.,ANALYSIS
2332,"
 8.  With regard to nature of seized article whether it is liquor or not.",ANALYSIS
2333,"
 P.W. 2 stated that the seized article is I.D. liquor.",ANALYSIS
2334,"No document is filed or proved on behalf of prosecution to establish that P.W. 2 is competent enough to opine on the subject of liquor, spirit or intoxicant being an expert U/s. 45 of Indian Evidence Act.",ANALYSIS
2335,No distillery training certificate has been filed on his behalf.,ANALYSIS
2336,Further this witness has admittedly stated in cross- examination that he had not sent the seized article or samples for chemical examination which is one of the surest test.,ANALYSIS
2337,"Hence, I hold that prosecution failed to establish that the seized article is I.D. liquor.",RATIO
2338,"
 9.       In view of the whole discussions in foregoing paragraphs, since the prosecution failed to establish that the seizure is from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused, I hold that prosecution failed to establish the charge leveled against the accused person for commission of offence U/s.47(a)(i) of Bihar & Orissa Excise Act beyond all reasonable doubt.",RATIO
2339,"Hence, I acquit him therefrom under the provisions of Sec.248(1) Cr.P.C.",RPC
2340,He be set at liberty and discharged from his bail bond.,RPC
2341,Enter the case as mistake of fact.,RPC

 The main question with reference to which the certificate was granted by the High Court, was: whether s.

2444,"But Mr.
Chaudhry, appearing for the appellant, does not press this question now before us.",ANALYSIS
2445,"The first contention canvassed by the Counsel is that on the facts and circumstances of the case, the appellant's statement recorded under s. 108 of the Customs Act 1962, on the foot of which the appellant has been convicted, was hit by clause (3) of Article 20 because at the time of making that statement, the appellant was ""accused of any offence""
under s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act, and the statement was obtained under compulsion of law.",ARG_PETITIONER
2446,"Stress has been placed on the fact that the appellant was, in fact, arrested by the police on a charge under s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act and the goods were seized under a Panchnama, prepared by them in the course of investigation.",ARG_PETITIONER
2447,"In this connection, reference has been made toM. P. Sharma and Ors. v. Satish Chandra, District Magistrate, Delhi and",ARG_PETITIONER
2448,Ors.(1),ARG_PETITIONER
2449,"On the other hand, Mr. H. R. Khanna, appearing for the respondent submits that the words ""accused of any offence""
occurring in Art. 20(3) take in only that person against whom a formal accusation of an offence has been levelled.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2450,"
Two other conditions for the applicability of this Clause, according to the Counsel, are: (a) that the testimony in question had been obtained under compulsion, and (b) it relates to the offence of which he stands formally accused.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2451,"
These conditions, it is maintained, were not fulfilled in the present case.",ANALYSIS
2452,"
 Clause (3) of Article 20 provides: ""No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself"".",STA
2453,"
         From an analysis of this clause, it is apparent that in order to claim the benefit of the guarantee against testimonial compulsion embodied in this clause, it must be shown, firstly, that the person who made the statement was ""accused of any offence"" secondly, that he made this statement under compulsion.",ANALYSIS
2454,"The phrase ""accused of any offence"" has been the subject of several decisions of this Court so that by now it is well settled that only a person against whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence has been levelled which in the normal course may result in his prosecution, would fall within its ambit.",ANALYSIS
2455,"In R. C. Mehta v. State of West Bengal, this point came up for consideration in the context of a statement recorded by an officer of Customs in an enquiry under s. 171-A of the Sea Customs Act.",PRE_RELIED
2456,"One of the contentions raised was, that a person against whom such an enquiry is made is a `person accused of an offence', and on that account, he cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself and the statement obtained or evidence collected under the aforesaid provision by the officer of Customs is inadmissible.",PRE_RELIED
2457,This contention was repelled.,PRE_RELIED
2458,"Shah J., speaking for the Court, made these apposite observations: ""Under s. 171-A of the Sea Customs Act, a Customs officer has power in an enquiry in connection with the smuggling of goods to summon any person whose attendance he considers necessary, to give evidence or to produce a document or any other thing, and by cl.
         (3) the person so summoned is bound to state the truth upon any subject respecting which he is examined or makes statements and to produce such documents and other things as may be required.",PRE_RELIED
2459,"The expression ""any person"" includes a person who is suspected or believed to be concerned in the smuggling of goods.",PRE_RELIED
2460,"But a person arrested by a Customs officer because he is found in possession of smuggled goods or on suspicion that he is concerned in smuggling is not when called upon by the Customs officer to make a statement or to produce a document or thing, a person accused of an         offence within the meaning of Art. 20(3) of the Constitution.",PRE_RELIED
2461,The steps taken by the Customs officer are for the purpose of holding an enquiry under the Sea Customs Act and for adjudging confiscation of goods dutiable or prohibited and imposing penalties.,PRE_RELIED
2462,The Customs officer does not at that stage accuse the person suspected of infringing the provisions of the Sea Customs Act with the commission of any offence.,PRE_RELIED
2463,"His primary duty is to prevent smuggling and to recover duties of customs when collecting evidence in respect of smuggling against a person suspected of infringing the provisions of the Sea Customs Act he is not accusing the person of any offence punishable at a trial before a magistrate"".",PRE_RELIED
2464,"
         After a survey of case law, the Court pointed out the circumstances, the existence of which is ordinarily necessary to clothe a person with the character of a ""person accused of an offence"": ""Normally a person stands in the character of an accused when a First Information Report is lodged.
         against him in respect of an offence before an officer competent to investigate it, or when a complaint is made relating to the commission of an offence before a Magistrate competent to try or send to another Magistrate for trial the offence.",PRE_RELIED
2465,"Where a Customs officer arrests a person and informs that person of the grounds of his arrest (which he is bound to do under Art. 221) of the Constitution for the purpose of holding an enquiry into the infringement of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act which he has reason to believe has taken place, there is no formal accusation of an offence.",PRE_RELIED
2466,"In the case of an offence by infringement of the Sea Customs Act and punishable at the trial before a Magistrate, there is an accusation when a complaint is lodged by an officer competent in that behalf before the Magistrate"".
         ",PRE_RELIED
2467,The above-quoted observations are a complete answer to the contention of the appellant.,ANALYSIS
2468,"In the light of these principles, it is clear that when the statement of the appellant was recorded by the Customs officer under s. 108, the appellant was not a person ""accused of any offence""
under the Customs Act, 1962.",ANALYSIS
2469,"An accusation which would stamp him with the character of such a person was, levelled only when the complaint was filed against him, by the Assistant Collector of Customs complaining of the commission of offences under s. 135(a) and s. 135(b) of the Customs Act.",ANALYSIS
2470,"
         True, that the appellant was arrested by the police on December 12, 1967 on suspicion of having committed an offence under s. 124, of the Bombay Police Act and a Panchnama of the packages in the truck was also prepared.",ANALYSIS
2471,"
But the factual ingredients of that offence are materially different from those of an offence under the Customs Act.",ANALYSIS
2472,"
 This will be apparent from a bare reading of s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act, which provides : ""Whoever has in his possession or conveys in any manner, or offers for sale or pawn, anything which there is         reason to believe is stolen property or property fraudulently obtained shall, if he fails to account for such possession or to act to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a term (which may extend to one year but shall not, except for reasons to be recorded in writing, be less taken one month and shall also be liable to the fine which may extend to five hundred rupees).
         Even in respect of that offence, the police did not register any case or enter any F.I.R. which normally furnishes a foundation for commencing a police investigation.",STA
2473,The police did not open the packages or prepare inventories of the goods packed therein.,ANALYSIS
2474,"Indeed, the police appear to have dropped further proceedings.",ANALYSIS
2475,"They did not take any steps for prosecuting the appellant even for an offence under the Bombay Police Act, 1951.",ANALYSIS
2476,"They informed the customs authorities, who opened the packages, inspected the goods and on finding them contraband goods, seized them under a Panchnama.",ANALYSIS
2477,"The Customs authorities called the appellant and his companion to the Customs House, took them into custody, and after due compliance with the requirements of law, the Inspector of Customs questioned the appellant and recorded his statement under s. 108 of the Customs Act.",ANALYSIS
2478,"
Under the circumstances it was manifest that at the time when the Custom officer recorded the statement of the appellant, the latter was not formally ""accused of any offence.""",ANALYSIS
2479,The High Court was therefore right in holding that the statement recorded by the Inspector of Customs was not hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution.,ANALYSIS
2480,"The next question to be considered is, whether this statement was hit by s. 24 of the Evidence Act.",ISSUE
2481,The contention is that this statement was obtained under compulsion of law inasmuch as he was required to state the truth under threat of prosecution for perjury.,ANALYSIS
2482,"
         For reasons that follow, we are unable to sustain this contention.",ANALYSIS
2483,"
         To attract the prohibition enacted in s. 24, Evidence Act, these facts must be established: (i) that the statement in question is a confession; (ii) that such confession has been made by an accused person; (iii)that it has been made to a person in authority; (iv) that the confession has been obtained by reason of any inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority; (v) such inducement, threat or promise, must have reference to the charge against the accused person; (vi) the inducement, threat or promise must in the opinion of the Court be sufficient to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him reasonable, for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.",ANALYSIS
2484,"
         In the present case, facts (i), (iv) and (vi) have not been established.",ANALYSIS
2485,"Firstly, the statement in question is not a ""confession' within the contemplation of s. 24.",ANALYSIS
2486,"It is now well-settled that a statement in order to amount to a ""confession"" must either admit in terms the offence, or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the offence.",ANALYSIS
2487,"An admission of an incriminating fact, howsoever grave, is not by itself a confession.",ANALYSIS
2488,"A statement which contains an exculpatory assertion of some fact, which if true, would negative the offence alleged, cannot amount to a confession (see Pakala Narayana v. R.; Plavinder Kaur v.
State of Punjab; Om Prakash v. State.
         ",PRE_RELIED
2489,A perusal of the statement Ex. I made by the appellant before the Inspector of Customs would show that it contained exculpatory matter.,ANALYSIS
2490,"Therein, the deponent claimed that he was not aware that the packages which were loaded in the truck were contraband goods, and alleged that the goods were not loaded under his instructions.",ANALYSIS
2491,"The deponent claimed to be an innocent traveller in the truck when he said: ""I did not ask Mullaji (driver) what goods were being loaded in his lorry...",ANALYSIS
2492,"Mullaji was only my friend and I was not aware of any of his mala fide activities"".",ANALYSIS
2493,"
         Moreover, the incriminating facts admitted in this statement, do not, even if taken cumulatively amount to admission of all the facts which constitute any offence.",ANALYSIS
2494,"To bring home an offence under s. 135 of the Customs Act, in addition to the facts admitted in Ex. I, it had to be established further that these goods were contraband goods.",ANALYSIS
2495,"
         For these reasons, it could be said beyond doubt, that the statement Ex. 1 was not a ""confession"" within the meaning of s. 24, Evidence Act.",ANALYSIS
2496,"
         Secondly, it has not been shown that the Customs officer-though a person in authority-had offered any inducement or held out any threat or promise to the appellant.",ANALYSIS
2497,"
         Christopher Soares, the Inspector of (Customs (P. W. 4) testified that no threats, coercion or inducements were used and that the statement Ex. 1 was made by the appellant, voluntarily.
         ",FAC
2498,"While it may be conceded that a person summoned by an officer of Customs to make a statement under s. 108 of the Customs Act, is under compulsion of law to state the truth, the compulsion there under, assuming it amounts to a threat, does not proceed ""from a person in authority"" within the contemplation of s. 24, but emanates from law.",ANALYSIS
2499,"
         Thirdly, the mere fact that the Inspector of Customs had, before recording the statement, warned the deponent of the possibility of hisprosecution for perjury in case he did not make the statement truthfully, cannot be construed as a threat held out by the officer which could have reasonably caused the person making the statement to suppose that he would by making that statement, gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him for smuggling.
         ",ANALYSIS
2500,"In view of what has been said above, we have no hesitation in holding that the statement Ex. 1, was not barred under s. 24, Evidence Act.",ANALYSIS
2501,"The statement Ex. P-1 was clearly admissible under s. 21, Evidence Act as an admission of incriminating facts.",ANALYSIS
2502,"
         Lastly, Mr. Chaudhry tried to contend that the incriminating facts admitted in Ex. 1 taken along with the other facts appearing in the evidence of prosecution witnesses, were insufficient to establish an offence under s. 135, Customs Act against the appellant because no notification under sub-s. (2) of s. 123, of the Customs Act had been issued in respect of the import of the goods of the kind seized, and the aid of the statutory presumption under that section was not available to the prosecution.
 ",ANALYSIS
2503,We are unable to accept this contention.,ANALYSIS
2504,"While it is true that in the absence of the requisite notification, the statutory presumption under s. 123 could not be invoked by the prosecution, the circumstances established unerringly raise an inference with regard to all the factual ingredients of an offence under s. 135(b) read with s.
 135(ii) of the Customs Act.",ANALYSIS
2505,"In Ex. 1 which was proved by P.W. 4, it is admitted that these packages which were later found to contain contraband goods by the Customs authorities, were surreptitiously loaded in the truck under cover of darkness at Reti Bunder (sea shore) from the side of sea-side wall, in the presence of the appellant, and thereafter the first accused took the wheel, while the appellant sat by his side in the truck, and drove towards Sandhurst Station.",ANALYSIS
2506,"It is further admitted that some Bania paid Rs. 2,000/- to the appellant which was meant to be given to the driver of the truck.",ANALYSIS
2507,"Unfortunately, the truck skidded near the Dongri Police Station and came to a stop.",ANALYSIS
2508,"On hearing the impact of the accident, the police came out, took both the accused into the Police Station and seized the truck and the goods.",ANALYSIS
2509,"In short, the. appellant had clearly admitted that these packages containing the contraband goods were imported surreptitiously from Reti Bunder under cover of darkness.",ANALYSIS
2510,"It was further established de-hors the statement of the appellant, that these packages, on opening by the Customs officer, were found to contain contraband goods of foreign make.",ANALYSIS
2511,They were brand new articles packed.,ANALYSIS
2512,"
 The circumstances of the arrest of the appellant while escaping from the truck, the seizure of the truck and the goods, the contraband nature of the goods, the fact that at the time of the seizure, the goods, were in the charge of the appellant, the fact that no duty on these goods had been paid, the seizure of Rs. 2,000/- as cash from the appellant etc. were proved by evidence aliunde rendered by P. Ws. 1 and 2.",ANALYSIS
2513,"To some extent, the hostile witness, P.W. 5, also, supported the prosecution.",ANALYSIS
2514,"The circumstances established unmistakably and irresistibly pointed to the conclusion that the appellant was knowingly concerned in a fraudulent attempt at evasion, if not, fraudulent evasion, of duty chargeable on those contraband goods.",RATIO

ACT:
Indian Penal Code (Act 45 of 1860), s. 499 Expln. 2 and Code
of Criminal Procedure (Act 5 of 1898) s. 198-Defamation of
collection of persons-When member of the body can complain
as aggrieved person.

HEADNOTE:
The Dravida Kazhagam sponsored and organised a conference.",PREAMBLE
2519,"
But the conference was a separate body with its own
organisation and office where correspondence relating to it
was received and dealt with, and it had its own Secretaries.",PREAMBLE
2520,The conference passeda number of resolutions.,PREAMBLE
2521,"The draft
of one of the resolutions was put in shape by the respondent
Who was a member of the Dravida Kazhagam.",PREAMBLE
2522,"It was however
moved by the president of the conference and passed by the
conference.",PREAMBLE
2523,"The appellants were either editors or publishers
of newspapers in which a news item was published about the
conference.",PREAMBLE
2524,"The news item however did not mention either
the Dravida Kazhagam or the respondent or any sponsor of the
resolution eithter by name or otherwise.",PREAMBLE
2525,"The respondent
wrote letter to the appellants, signing and describing
himself' as Chairman of the Reception Committee of the
conference, containing that the news item had distorted the
resolution and asked them to publish a correction and
clarification.",PREAMBLE
2526,"A few days later, a lawyers notice was sent
to the appellants in which the respondent complained that
the news item was defamatory and had tarnished the image of
the conference and demanded an apology.",PREAMBLE
2527,"Thereafter, the
respondent filed a complaint under Ss. 500 and 501, I.P.C.
against the appellants as they did not tender any apology.",PREAMBLE
2528,"
on the basis of the complaint and the evidence he recorded,
the Magistrate issued process.",PREAMBLE
2529,"The appellants moved the
High Court under s. 561 A, Cr-. P.C., for quashing the
proceedings.",PREAMBLE
2530,"They contended that the respondent was not ,in
aggrieved part\, within the meaning of s. 198, Cr.P.
C., that he had filed the complaint in his capacity as
Chairman of the Reception Committee of the conference and
not in his individual capacity, that in the absence of any
reference to him in the news item he had no cause for a
complaint, and that the conference, 'being an undefined and
an amorphous body, the respondent, is a member or part of

such body, could not lodge the complaint.",PREAMBLE
2531,"The High Court,

however, held that the respondent was a member of the

Dravida Kazhagam which was an identifiable group, and was

therefore a person aggrieved within the meaning of s. 198,

Cr.P.C.

Allowing the appeal to this Court and quashing ;the

proceedings taken by     the Magistrate,

HELD: (1) Under s. 198, Cr.P.C.",PREAMBLE
2532,", no Magistrate can take

cognizance of an offence falling inter alia under Chap.

XXI, I.P.C., that is, ss. 499 to 502, except on a

complaint made by some persons aggrieved by such offence.",PREAMBLE
2533,"

The section is mandatory, so 'that, if a Magistrate were to

take cognizance of the offence of defamation on a complaint

filed by one who is not an aggrieved person the trial and

conviction of the accused would be void and illegal.",PREAMBLE
2534,"[48A-C]

(2)Section 499, I.P.C., defines defamation and lays down

that whoever by words, either spoken or intended to be read

or by signs etc., makes

or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending

to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that the

imputation will harm the reputation of such person is said

to defame that person.",PREAMBLE
2535,"Explanation 2 to the section lays

down that it may amount to defamation to make an imputation

concerning a company or an association or collection of

persons.",PREAMBLE
2536,"But such a collection of persons must be an

identifiable body, so, that, it is possible to say with

definiteness that a group of particular persons ,is

distinguished from the rest, of the community, was defamed.",PREAMBLE
2537,"

Therefore, in a case where Explanation 2 is resorted to the

identify of the company or the association or the collection

of persons must be established so as to be relatable to the

defamatory words or imputations.",PREAMBLE
2538,"If a well defined class is

defamed, every particular member' of that class can file a

complaint even if the defamatory imputation does not mention

him by name.",PREAMBLE
2539,"[48C-G, 50C, G-H]",PREAMBLE
2540,"

(3)The test whether the members of a class deamed are or

not would not be apt in a criminal prosecution where,",PREAMBLE
2541,"

technically speaking, it is not by the persons injured but

by the state that criminal proceedings are carried on and a

complaint can. lie in a case of libel against a class of

persons provided always that such in class is not

indeterminate or 'indefinite but, a definite one.",PREAMBLE
2542,"There is

no difference in principle between this rule of the Common

Law of England and the rule laid down in Explanation 2 to s.

(4)But in the present case, the conference was a body

distinct from the Dravida Kazhagam party.",PREAMBLE
2543,"That the

conference was organised by the party would not mean that

both were the same or that the members of the party any

those of the conference or those who, attended it were the

same.",PREAMBLE
2544,"In fact, the principal function of the reception

committee would be to enroll members of the conference and

collect funds to defray its expenses.",PREAMBLE
2545,"The evidence of the

respondent also indicated that the conference was attended

not only by members of the Dravida Kazhagam party but also

by outsiders.",PREAMBLE
2546,"it is therefore wrong to identify one with the

other or to say that a defamation of the conference as a

class or collection of persons was defamation of the Dravida

Kazhagam party.",PREAMBLE
2547,"The news item complained of clearly stated

that the resolution was by the conference and not by the


Dravida Kazhagam.",PREAMBLE
2548,"The respondent in his letters made no
grievance that the Drivida Kazhagam suffered injury in
reputation or otherwise by 'the alleged distortion.",PREAMBLE
2549,"His case
throughout was that the publication had tarnished the
image.not of the Dravida Kazhagam, but of the conference.",PREAMBLE
2550,[51C-G; 52A-B],PREAMBLE
2551,"
(6) Therefore, the High Court missed the realissue.",PREAMBLE
2552,"Whether
the Dravida Kazhagam was an identifiable group or not was
beside the point, for, what had to be decided was whether
the conference was a determinate and identifiable body so
that defamatory words used in relation to the resolution
would be defamation of the individuals who composed it.and
the respondent, as one of such individuals could maintain
tile complaint.",PREAMBLE
2553,f.@ 2C-F,PREAMBLE
2554,"]
(7) The conference clearly was not an identifiable or
definitive body so that all those who attended it could be
said to be its constituents, who.",PREAMBLE
2555,"if the conference was
defamed, would, in their turn, be said to be defamed.",PREAMBLE
2556,"It is impossible to have any definite idea as to its
composition, the number of persons who attended, the ideas
and ideologies to which they subscribed, and whether all of
them positively agreed to the resolution in question.",PREAMBLE
2557,"The
evidence was that the person presiding read out the
resolution and because no one got up to oppose it was taken
as approved by all.[52F-H]

The complaint came to be filed in the following circumstances The Dravida Kazhagam, a party having a platform for social reforms, has, according to counsel for the respondent, a membership of about 4000 persons in Madras city and elsewhere.",FAC
2567,"The aims and objects of the party are to bring about social reforms and in particular to eradicate certain customs and practices, which, according to its promoters, are sheer superstitions.",FAC
2568,"The party sponsored and organised a conference, which held its sessions on January 23 and 24, 1971.",FAC

But the news item stated that it was the conference 'and not the Dravida Kazhagam which had passed the resolution set out in it as aforesaid.",FAC
2582,"
On January 28, 1971, the respondent, signing as the chairman of the reception committee of the said conference, called upon the editor of the Hindu to publish a correction and clarification stating that the resolution published in that daily was distorted version of the resolution actually passed by the conference, that the resolution passed by the conference was that ""it should not be made an offence for a person's wife to desire another man"", and not that a man coveting another man's wife should not be an offence, and that those who were aware of the opinions of the said E V.
Ramaswami Naicker would find that the resolution was in keeping with his views, namely, that marriage was a contract terminable at the instance of either party and not an interminable sacrament, and lastly, that the resolution was intended to highlight the disabilities of women which prevented them,from attaining their full stature.",FAC
2583,"On February 1971, the Hindu published the said clarification as demanded by the respondent under the caption ""Salem Conference Resolutions""
together with the version of its own representative at Salem according to which the resolution passed by the conference was the one ,Published in the Hindu On February 1, 1971, the respondent, by his Advocate's letter, called upon the editor to publish the correct text of the resolution starting that what was published in the Hindu was ""not only a travesty of truth but also highly defamatory so as to tarnish the image of the conference"", of whose reception committee he was the chairman and called upon the editor to express an apology.",FAC

Ramaswami Naicker.",FAC
2586,"He further stated that the Dravida Kazhagam had organised the said conference for the eradication of superstitious beliefs, that he was the chairman of its reception committee, that the conference passed several resolutions, one of which was the resolution advocating that it should not be an offence for a person's wife to ;desire another man, that he was one of the members responsible ""'for sponsoring and piloting that resolution"", that the conference was attended ""by a large number of leaders, members, followers. sympathizers of the Kazhagam, besides a large number of public at large, occupying varied strata of the society"" and that the Hindu published a wrong version of the said resolution implying that the resolution advocated adultery, an offence under the Penal Code.",FAC

2616,"The appellants' main contention before the High Court was that the respondent was not an aggrieved party within the meaning of s. 198 of the Code, that he had filed the complaint in his capacity as the chairman. of the reception committee of the conference and not in 'his individual capacity, that in the absence of any reference to him in the said news item he had no cause for complaint, and that the conference being an undefined and an amorphous body, the respondent as a member or part of such a body could not lodge the complaint.",ANALYSIS
2617,"A learned Single Judge of the High Court, who heard the said applications, rejected the said contention in the following words : ""The Dravida Kazhagam is an identifiable group, The complainant is a member of this Kazhagam.",RLC
2618,He was the Chairman of the Reception Committee in the conference.,RLC
2619,He is active member of the Dravida Kazhagam.,RLC
2620,He was one of those who piloted and sponsored the resolution.,RLC
2621,Certainly be is a person aggrieved                         within the meaning of section 19B of the Criminal procedure Code.,RLC
2622,"The complaint by him is competent.""",RLC
2623,"
The statement in this para that the respondent piloted and sponsored the resolution in question was factually incorrect, as the respondent's evidence itself showed that the resolution was moved not by him, but by the President of the conference, who read it out and as no one opposed, it was taken to have been approved by all.",ANALYSIS
2624,"The, only thing which the respondent claimed to have done as the chairman of the reception committee was to give shape to the, draft resolution by abridging it.",ANALYSIS
2625,"The respondent may have been interested in the resolution and its being passed, but the resolution certainly was neither moved nor piloted by him.",ANALYSIS
2626,"
Indeed, if any one could be said to have piloted it, it was the president of the conference.",ANALYSIS
2627,"Furthermore, the resolution was of the conference and the only contribution of the respondent to it was his having given shape to the original draft.",ANALYSIS
2628,"
Counsel for the appellants seriously challenged the correct- ness of the paragraph from the High Court's judgment quoted above, that being the really operative and decisive part of the judgment, firstly, on the ground that those observations were not in consonance with s. 198 of the Code even when read with s. 499, Expl (2) of the Penal Code, and secondly, on the ground of the failure of the High Court to perceive the separate entities of the Dravida Kazhagam and the conference and its omission to realise that the, resolution was the resolution of the Conference and not of the Dravida Kazhagam.",ARG_PETITIONER
2629,"The news item in question referred to the conference and not to the Dravida Kazhagam, and therefore, if anybody was defamed by the said news item, it was the conference and not the 'Dravida Kazhagam which had only organised that conference.",ARG_PETITIONER
2630,"Mr. Frank Anthony, on the other hand, urged that though it was the, conference which had passed the resolution and though the news item referred to that conference and not to the Dravida Kazhagam and the respondent was not mentioned or referred to therein, in substance and in effect it was the Dravida Kazhagam which was defamed, for, it was that party which had organised the conference and sponsored the resolutions passed thereat.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2631,"Therefore, the respondent, as a leading member of that party and the chairman of the reception committee, could claim that the defamatory imputations in the said news item were, relatable to him and the other members of the Dravida Kazhagam, and he was consequently entitled to file the complaint.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2632,"On these contentions, the principal question for determina- tion is whether the respondent could be said to be an aggrieved person entitled to maintain the complaint within the meaning of s. 198 of the Code.",ANALYSIS
2633,"That section lays down that no magistrate shall take cognizance of an offence falling inter alia under Ch. XXI of the Penal Code (that is, ss. 499 to 502) except upon a complaint made by some persons aggrieved of such offence.",STA
2634,"Sec. 198, thus, lays down an exception to the general rule that a complaint 'can be filed by anybody whether he is an aggrieved person or not and modifies that rule by permitting only an aggrieved person to move a magistrate in cases of defamation.",STA
2635,"The section is mandatory, so that if a magistrate were to take cognizance of the, offence of defamation on a complaint filed by one who is not an aggrieved person, the ;trial and conviction of an accused in such a case by the magistrate would be void and illegal.",ANALYSIS
2636,"
 Prima facie, therefore, if s. 193 of the Code were to be noticed by itself, the complaint in the present case would be unsustainable, since the news item in question did not mention the respondent nor did it contain any defamatory imputation against him individually.",ANALYSIS
2637,"Sec. 499 of the Penal Code, which defines defamation, laid down that whoever by words, either spoken or intended to be read or by signs etc.
 makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person, intending to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that the imputation will harm he reputation of such person, is said to defame that person.",STA
2638,This part of the section makes defamation in respect of an individual an offence.,ANALYSIS
2639,"
 But Explanation (2) to the section lays down the rifle that it may amount to defamation to make an imputation concerning a company or an association or collection of persons as such.",STA
2640,A defamatory imputation against a collection of persons thus falls within the definition of defamation.,ANALYSIS
2641,"The languageage of the Explanation is wide, and therefore, besides a company or  an association, any collection of persons would be covered by it  ",ANALYSIS
2642,"But such a collection of persons must be an identifiable body so that it is possible to say with definiteness that a group of particular persons, as distinguished. from the rest of the community, was defamed",ANALYSIS
2643,"Therefore, in a case where Explanation (2) is re- sorted to, the identity of the company or the association or the collection of persons must be established so as to be relatable to the defamatory words or imputations.",ANALYSIS
2644,"Where a writing inveigh,,,, against mankind in a general. or against a particular order of men, e.g., men of own, it is no libel.",ANALYSIS

2659,"The House of Lords rejected the action, Lord Simon saying that was an essential element of the cause of action in a libel action that the words complained of should be published of the plaintiff, that where he was not named, the test would be whether the words would reasonably lead people acquainted with him to the conclusion that he was the person referred to.",PRE_RELIED
2660,"The question whether they did so in fact would not arise if they could not in law be regarded as capable of referring to him, and that was not so as the imputations were in regard respect of the party which was in Paris and America.",PRE_RELIED

2662,The principle laid down here was that there can be no civil action for libel if it relates to a class of persons who are too numerous and unascertainable to join as plaintiffs.,PRE_RELIED

2665,"Mr. Anthony, however, was right in submitting that the test whether the members of a class defamed are numerous or not would not be apt in a criminal prosecution where technically speaking it is not by the persons injured but by the state that criminal proceedings are carried on and a complaint can lie in a case of libel against a class of persons provided always that such a class is not indeterminate or indefinite but a definite one.",PRE_RELIED

2669,"When, therefore, Expl. (2) to s. 499 talks of a collection of persons as capable of being defamed, such collection of persons must mean a definite and a determinate body.",PRE_RELIED

2676,"This being the position in law, the question upon which these appeals must be decided is: which was the class or body in respect of which defamatory words were used and whether that body was a definite and an identifiable body or class so that the imputations in question can be said to relate to its individual components enabling an individual member of it to maintain a complaint ?
 ",ANALYSIS
2677,"The High Court, after citing Tek Chand's case(1) went on to say that the Dravida Kazhagam was an identifiable group, that the respondent was an active member of that body, that he was also the chairman of the reception committee of the conference and that he was one of those who piloted and sponsored the resolution, which was said to have been wrongly reproduced and distorted in the news item in question.",ANALYSIS
2678,"Apart from the fact already mentioned by us earlier that neither the complaint nor the evidence of the respondent indicated that the resolution was piloted by him, the news item nowhere referred to or even mentioned the Dravida Kazhagam.",ANALYSIS
2679,"As already pointed out, the conference was a body distinct from that party, having its own Organisation, its own secretaries who dealt with the correspondence to and by the conference and its own office where its work was conducted.",ANALYSIS
2680,"No doubt, the conference was organised by the Dravida Kazhagam, but that would not mean that both were the same or that the members of the Dravida Kazhagam and those of the conference or those who attended it were the same.",ANALYSIS
2681,"Indeed, the principal function of the reception committee would be to enroll members of the conference and thus collect funds to defray its expenses.",ANALYSIS
2682,"
 In fact, the evidence of the respondent indicated that the conference was attended not only by the members of the Dravida Kazhagam but also by outsiders who included as many as 5000 women.",ANALYSIS
2683,"It is therefore, wrong to identify one with the other or to say that defamation of the conference as a class or collection of persons was the defamation of the Dravida Kazhagam.",ANALYSIS
2684,That was not and indeed could not be the case of the respondent.,ANALYSIS
2685,"
 The news item complained of clearly stated that the resolu- tion was passed by the conference and not by the Dravida Ka- zhagain.",ANALYSIS
2686,"In his very first letter, dated January 28, 1971, which the respondent signed describing himself as the chairman of the reception committee and not as, an important member of the Dravida Kazhagam, the respondent complained that the news item had distorted the resolution passed by the conference and asked the editor to publish his ""correction and clarification of that resolution.",ANALYSIS
2687,There is no grievance there that the Dravida Kazhagam suffered injury in reputation or otherwise by that alleged (1) [1969] Cr. L.J. 536.distortion.,ANALYSIS
2688,"In his advocates letter dated February 1, 1971, the respondent's complaint was that the news item was highly defamatory and had tarnished the image of the conference of whose reception committee he was the chairman.",ANALYSIS
2689,In his evid- ence before the Magistrate also as clearly stated that the resolution was the resolution moved by the president of the committee and passed by the conference.,ANALYSIS
2690,"Thus, his case throughout was that the publication of the said resolution reported in the said news item in a distorted form had tarnished the image not of the Dravida Kazhagam but of the conference.",ANALYSIS
2691,"
That being so, the High Court completely missed the real issue, viz., whether the conference was a determinate and an identifiable body so that defamatory words used in relation to the resolution passed by it would be defamation of the individuals who composed it, and the respondent, as one such individuals and chairman of its reception committee could maintain a complaint under s. 500 of the Penal Code.",ANALYSIS
2692,"
Whether the Dravida Kaghagam was an identifiable group or not was beside the point, for, what had to be decided was whether the conference which passed the resolution in question and which was said to have distorted was such a determinate body, like the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak in Tek Chand's case(',) or the body of public prosecutors in Sahib Singh Mehra's case(1) as to make defamation with respect to it a cause of complaint by its individual members.",ANALYSIS
2693,In our view the High Court misdirected itself by missing the real and true issue arising in the applications before it and deciding an issue which did not arise from those applications.,ANALYSIS
2694,"The judgment of the High Court, 'based on an extraneous issue, therefore, cannot be sustained.",ANALYSIS
2695,"
In this view of the matter, we would have ordinarily remanded the case to the High Court.",RATIO

Of Excise, Panposh, Rourkela was performing patrolling duty along with other official staffs, they conducted raid in the house of the accused and recovered one plastic jerrycane containing 10 litres of country made mahua liquor.",FAC
2714,"After that S.I. Of Excise conducted smell test, tongue test, blue litmus paper test, hydrometer test.",FAC
2715,"By conducting hydrometer test, the temperature was found to be 720 F, indication to be 82.6 and strength to be 52.20 UP.",FAC

2722,"
Hence, this case.",FAC
2723,3. The Plea of the defence is of outright denial and false implication.,FAC
2724,4. The following points arose for determination in the present case: I.,ISSUE
2725,"Whether on 09.12.2001at about 12.30 P.M. at Turiberna area, Munia Puran, the accused, was detected by the Excise officials to be in exclusive and conscious possession of one plastic jerrycane containing 10 litres of I.D liquor without any license or authority?",ISSUE
2726,II. Whether the seized article was nothing but I.D liquor?,ISSUE
2727,5. In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined 2 witnesses in all out of whom P.W. 1 is the independent witness to the seizure and Ext. 2 is the Excise constable.,FAC
2728,Rest one witness has been declined by the learned A.P.P. Ext.s 1 and 1/1 are marked on behalf of the prosecution.,FAC
2729,"On the other hand, defence has neither examined any witnesses nor marked any documents as exhibits on its behalf.",FAC
2730,6. The learned defence counsel has argued that the case is falsely foisted against the accused and no such occurrence took place to which the learned APP vehemently objected.,ARG_RESPONDENT
2731,"7. On appreciation of evidence on record P.W.2, the Excise Constable has deposed that on 09.12.2001 he was performing patrolling duty at Turiberna area along with his official staffs.",FAC
2732,During patrolling duty they detected one person with a plastic jerrycane which contained 10 litres of I.D liquor.,FAC
2733,The seizure list has been admitted into evidence vide Ext.1 and his signature as Ext.1/1.,FAC
2734,The independent witness examined in this case has deposed that he does not know anything about the present case and further stated that nothing was seized in his presence.,FAC
2735,8. The next question to be determined is whether the seizure was made from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused.,ANALYSIS
2736,To this the learned counsel for the accused submitted that the independent witness available in this case did not prove the search and seizure.,ARG_RESPONDENT
2737,The seized article was also not produced before the Court during the course of trial.,ARG_RESPONDENT
2738,"The witness examined in this case is the interested witness for the prosecution as such he cannot be relied upon and accordingly, the accused be acquitted.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2739,"Admittedly, the seized liquor has not been produced in the court.",ANALYSIS
2740,The witness examined is the interested witness whose evidence required corroboration by independent witness which is absent in this case.,ANALYSIS
2741,"In the absence of independent corroboration, the search and seizure of the contraband articles become doubtful.",ANALYSIS
2742,No documents relating to the ownership of the house were verified from the accused.,ANALYSIS
2743,The possibility that her husband and other inmates might have possessed the same can not be ruled out in the facts of this case.,ANALYSIS
2744,"When the evidence on this score is wanting, the criminal liability for the existence of the liquor can not be fastened on the accused beyond doubt.",ANALYSIS
2745,There is totally absence of evidence regarding the conscious possession of the I.D. Liquor by the accused.,ANALYSIS
2746,"In view of the above discussion, the fact that the seized article was recovered from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused becomes doubtful.",RATIO
2747,"Hence, it is concluded that prosecution has failed to prove the factum of seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts.",RATIO

 2.            The story of the prosecution, in brief, is that on dated 13.11.2009 the informant Madhusudan Chhatria appeared at Kinjirkela PS and lodged a written report alleging therein that on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM, when he was coming out of his house then the accused persons abused him in obscene words such as "" TU KI BANDAR MEMBER "" and also assaulted him as a result of which he sustained injuries on his person.",FAC

2822,4. The points for determination in this case are as follows:-,ISSUE
2823,"i)        Whether on dtd. 13.11.2009 at about 2.00 PM , in front of the house of the informant, the accused persons in furtherance of common intention wrongfully restrained the informant Madhusudan Chhatria on his way in which he has right to proceed ?",ISSUE
2824,"

2827,"
 5.      In order to substantiate its case, the prosecution has examined five witnesses, out of whom, P.W.2 is the informant of this case, P.W.1 is the doctor.
 P.W.3 Is the wife of P.W.2.",FAC
2828,P.W.4 and P.W.5 are the independent witnesses.,FAC
2829,"On the other hand, no-one was examined on behalf of the defense.",FAC

 6.                So far as the present case is concerned. P.W.2, the informant of this case deposed that he knows the accused persons who are his co-villagers.",FAC
2831,He deposed that he has lodged the FIR against the accused persons due to misunderstanding and he does not want proceed anything against the accused persons as the disputes has already been amicably settled within them outside the Court.,FAC
2832,He proved the FIR as Ext.2 and Ext.2/1 is his signature thereon.,FAC

 7.  The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused also submitted that the dispute has already been amicably settled outside the Court among themselves.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2839,So the accused persons are entitled for a clean acquittal.,ARG_RESPONDENT

 8.  Here in this case at hand, all of the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution have not uttered a single word implicating the accused persons in this case.",ANALYSIS
2841,Even the informant has not whispered a single word against the accused persons in this present case rather he has specifically stated that dispute has already been amicably settled between themselves.,ANALYSIS

2845,"
 In view of the above discussion and considering the available evidence on record, I am of the view that the prosecution has not adduced a single evidence to substantiate its charge against the accused persons , hence there is absolutely no evidence on record to implicate the accused persons in the present case.",RATIO

 Heard the learned Senior Advocate Shri G.Sarangan appearing for the Counsel for the petitioner, Shri Keshava Murthy and the learned Counsel for the respondent.",NONE
2865,"2. The petitioner is a registered dealer under the provisions of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (Hereinafter referred to as the `KVAT Act', for brevity) and is engaged in the manufacture and sale of rice bran oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower oil and soya oil, by employing solvent extraction process out of rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake, and soya seeds.",FAC
2866,While oil is liable to tax and the by-product de- oiled bran and cake is exempted from tax.,FAC
2867,"The petitioner claims that returns of turnover in Form VAT 100 for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 were filed compiled on the basis of books of accounts and the tax was paid as admitted therein.",ANALYSIS
2868,"In the said returns filed, the petitioner had claimed partial input rebate in terms of section 17 of the KVAT Act in respect of rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake and soya seeds used as input in the extraction of oil on the understanding of the law while filing returns that it was not eligible for full input tax rebate.",ANALYSIS
2869,The said returns are deemed as accepted under section 38(1) of the KVAT Act.,ANALYSIS
2870,"
 3. The first respondent audited the books of account for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 and had passed re-assessment orders under section 39(1) of the KVAT Act levying tax, penalty and interest.",ANALYSIS
2871,"In doing so, the prescribed authority had allowed the partial input rebate as per Section 17 of the KVAT Act, on the value of inputs namely, rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake and soya seed used in the extraction of oil on the understanding of law that the petitioner is not eligible for full input tax rebate.",ANALYSIS
2872,"
 4. Subsequent to the filing of the returns, a division bench of this court has rendered its judgment in M.K.Agro Tech Private Limited vs. State of Karnataka, 2014(18) KLJ 1, to the effect that when an assessee is in the business of manufacture of only one product, namely, oil and which is liable to tax, merely because in the process of manufacture of oil, certain by-product arises, which is sold and which is exempted from tax, that would not attract the provisions of Section 17 of the KVAT Act relating to partial rebate.",PRE_RELIED
2873,"This was the declaratory of the law and according to the petitioner, would always have been applicable to all assessments made prior to and after the date of the said judgment.",ANALYSIS
2874,"Therefore, the petitioner has filed an application under Section 69(1) relating to the tax period April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 before the first respondent, for rectification of the re-assessment orders and to grant full input tax rebate on the value of VAT.",ANALYSIS
2875,"That was rejected only on the ground that the petitioner ought to have made a claim for full tax rebate in the first instance and no such claim having been made would preclude it from doing so, since such a claim could have been made only within a period of six months and not beyond that and",ANALYSIS
2876,"hence, the question of considering the case of the petitioner for such full tax rebate would not arise.",ANALYSIS
2877,"Insofar as the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, is concerned, it is applied in favour of the assesses from the date of judgment and there can be no second opinion, though the revenue has sought to challenge the same before the apex court and is pending consideration.",ANALYSIS
2878,"5. The learned Government Advocate, while justifying the order, would submit that the question of rectification would not arise and it is a misconception on the part of the petitioner that they could file such a rectification application within a period of five years.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2879,"Since the statute was clear even as on the date the claim was made and in the absence of any such claim, the petitioner now seeking to raise such a claim by hindsight, notwithstanding that it is only after the judgment was delivered by a division bench in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, in that, it has dawned on the petitioner that it could have made such an application, cannot be countenanced and seeks to contend that if any such benefit is given, the revenue would suffer serious loss.",ARG_RESPONDENT
2880,"
 6. By way of reply, the learned Senior Advocate would point out that it is unfair on the part of the revenue to contend that such a claim should have been made in the first instance and that the petitioner is precluded from raising such a claim as on date, as it was a mutually understood position of law which prevented the assessees from raising such claim.",ARG_PETITIONER
2881,"For otherwise, if such claim had been made, it was quite possible that they would have been penalized for making such a claim and it is only on the legal position being settled by a decision of a division bench of this court that the benefit available to the petitioner has dawned on the petitioner and therefore, the rectification application was justified.",ARG_PETITIONER
2882,7. The point for consideration would be whether the petitioner could avail the benefit of the judgment which was rendered much after the assessment order was passed and whether such reassessment orders can be passed on their prayer for rectification of the earlier assessment.,ISSUE
2883,"
 8. In the above circumstances, in a situation where if the revenue were to be in the position of the assessee and if it was discovered that by virtue of the operation of law, the revenue was entitled to a certain amount from the dealers, it would have certainly turned the tables on the assessee and proceeding on that presumption, it would be only just and fair to direct the revenue to consider the prayer of the petitioner for rectification, when there is no dispute that they were entitled to full tax rebate by virtue of the decision in M.K.Agro Tech, supra.",PRE_RELIED
2884,It would be a formality for the respondent to pass a rectification order and grant full tax rebate to the petitioner in terms of its prayer.,ANALYSIS
2885,The petitions are allowed.,RPC
2886,"The impugned orders are set aside with direction to the first respondent to redo the same and give the petitioner the full benefit of the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech, supra.",RPC
2887,"
 The respondent having challenged the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech,supra, before the apex court, there is no order of stay.",RPC
